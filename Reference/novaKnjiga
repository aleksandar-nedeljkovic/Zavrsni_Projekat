translator s foreword 


t he customs and the minds of men alter less rapidly than the 
vagaries of political and ideological change  the visitor to 
yugoslavia can still see the bridge on the drina  whose fate is 
described in this book  though once again modernized and re  
paired  but he will find visegrad itself less changed than he may ex  
pect and will not find it hard to identify the types of andris s novel 
even under a national state and a communist administration  the 
bosnian peasant faces the hazards of an egalitarian administration 
with the same incomprehension and imperturbability as he faced 
the novelties of the austro hungarian occupation  he experienced 
the greater brutalities of the last war with the same courage and 
resignation as he faced those of world war i  and his relations 
with state controlled purchasing agencies differ mainly in degree 
from those of his fathers with the banks and merchants of the vise  
grad market  the last war  in bosnia especially  showed examples 
of horror and torment at least equal to those of turkish times  while 
the idealism and fanaticism of youth  so well described in the con  
versations on the kapia  have only changed slightly in direction  
while retaining their essential mixture of practical politics and 
imaginative romanticism  

dr ivo andrid is himself a serb and a bosnian  these provincial 
and religious subtleties are still as important in present day yugo  
slavia as they were in earlier times but in the case of dr andrid they 
have had an effect different from that on other yugoslav writers and 
politicians  

instead of intensifying the local and religious conflicts that still 
bedevil yugoslavia  as was only too tragically shown during the 
last war  they have resulted in a deep understanding of peoples and 
creeds other than his own  bom near travnik in northern bosnia in 
      dr andrid passed much of his childhood in visegrad  not only 
is there truth  insight and sympathy in his varied range of visegrad 
portraits  there is certainly also a good deal of observed and critical 
biography  

dr aniid s books are almost all about bosnia and bosnians  but 
the peculiar position of bosnia  a storm centre for centuries on the 
border of the eastern and western worlds  saves them from the curse 
of detailed provincialism and gives them an interest that extends 
far beyond its narrow borders  it would not be too much to say that 
the assassination of the austrian archduke franz ferdinand by 



gavrilo princip at sarajevo in      was the turning point of modern 
history  

dr andris s own career widened the field of his observations and 
his sympathies in a manner possible only in a vigorously growing 
society and a century of conflict he studied first at sarajevo and 
later at the universities of zagreb  vienna  cracow and graz  where 
he took his degree  of a poor artisan family  he made his way largely 
through his own ability  as other gifted students of his race and time  
and as his own students m the bridge on the drina  he belonged to 
the national revolutionary youth organization  and experienced 
the customary cycle of persecution and arrest  after the first world 
war he entered the yugoslav diplomatic service and served in rome  
bucharest  trieste and graz  at the outbreak of world war ii he was 
yugoslav minister in berlin  when yugoslavia was desperately play  
ing for time  hoping to postpone the invasion of hitler and at the 
same time consolidate her forces to resist it when it inevitably came  
i recall waiting tensely in belgrade for dr andrid to return from ber  
lin  the one sure sign that an invasion was immediate  he came back 
only a few hours before the first bombs fell on belgrade  my only 
contact with him was when the yugoslav government was already 
in flight  

during the war  dr andrid lived in retirement in belgrade  and 
during the german occupation took no part in public affairs therein 
we are the gainers  for at that time he wrote his most important 
works  including what may be called his bosnian trilogy  miss  the 
travnik chronicle and  the greatest of them all  the bridge on the 
drina  

the experiences of the war and the german occupation gave dr 
andrid sympathy with the yugoslav liberation movement  since 
the war  he has been associated with it and has been a member of the 
national assembly for many years  

the bridge on the drina is not a novel in the usual sense of the 
word  its scope is too vast  its characters too numerous  its period of 
action too long  it covers three and a half centuries  dr andrid him  
self calls it a chronicle  let us accept his word  

it has been awarded the highest literary award of post war yugo  
slavia and has been translated into several languages  

it is always an invidious task for a translator to comment on an 
author s style  it should be  and i hope it is  evident in the trans  
lation  andrid s style has the sweep and surge of the sea  slow and 
yet profound  with occasional flashes of wit and irony  one subtlety 
cannot  however  be conveyed in translation  his use of var dng dia  
lects and localisms  i have conveyed them in the best manner that i 



could  since a literal use of dialect would  even were it possible  be 
pedantic  dull and cumbersome  for the information of purists  the 
occasional turkish words that are used are used in their bosnian 
sense and spelhng which often differs considerably from modern 
literary turkish

note 

on the pronunciation of serbo croat names 

andrid s novel is published both in the cyrillic and latin  croat  
alphabets i have used the croatian spelling throughout  the 
language is strictly phonetic  one sound is almost always desig  
nated by one letter or  in croat  combination of letters  

generally speaking  the foreigner cannot go far wrong if he uses 
 continental  vowels and english consonants  with the following 
exceptions  

c is always ts  as in cats  
c is ch as in church  

  is similar but softer  as t in the cockney pronunciation of tube  
many family names end in d  for practical purposes  the foreigner 
may regard c and   as the same  
d  is the english j in judge  the english j in fact  
dz is practically the same  but harder  it is usually found in words 
of turkish origin  
j is always soft  the english y  

r is sometimes a vowel  strongly rolled  hence such strange look  
ing words as vrh  summit   

  is sh as in shake  
z is zh as z in azure  

other variations do not occur in this book in a few cases i have 
left the conventionally accepted english spelling  instead of insisting 
pedantically on serbo croat versions  e g sanjak  serbo croat  
sandzak   belgrade  serbo croat  beograd   etc in the case of purely 
turkish names  i have sometimes transliterated them phonetically  
as the croat version is equally arbitrary  

the use of the original names retains dignity and flavour 
attempts to adapt them to english phonetics  in itself an ungrateful 
task  results in such monstrosities as ts e rnche  for crnde

f or the greater part of its course the nver dnna flows through 
narrow gorges between steep mountains or through deep 
ravines with precipitous banks  in a few places only the river 
banks spread out to form valleys with level or rolling stretches 
of fertile land suitable for cultivation and settlement on both sides  
such a place exists here at visegrad  where the dnna breaks out in 
a sudden curve from the deep and narrow ravine formed by the 
butkovo rocks and the uzavnik mountains  the curve which the 
dnna makes here is particularly sharp and the mountains on both 
sides are so steep and so close together that they look like a solid 
mass out of which the river flows directly as from a dark wall  then 
the mountains suddenly widen into an irregular amphitheatre whose 
widest extent is not more than about ten miles as the crow flies  

here  where the dnna flows with the whole force of its green and 
foaming waters from the apparently closed mass of the dark steep 
mountains  stands a great clean cut stone bndge with eleven wide 
sweeping arches  from this bridge spreads fanlike the whole rolling 
valley with the little oriental town of vi egrad and all its surround  
ings  with hamlets nestling in the folds of the hills  covered with 
meadows  pastures and plum orchards  and criss crossed with walls 
and fences and dotted with shaws and occasional clumps of ever  
greens looked at from a distance through the broad arches of the 
white bridge it seems as if one can see not only the green drina  but 
all that fertile and cultivated countryside and the southern sky above  

on the right bank of the river  starting from the bridge itself  lay 
the centre of the town  with the market place  partly on the level 
and partly on the hillside  on the other side of the bndge  along the 
left bank  stretched the maluhino polje  with a few scattered houses 
along the road which led to sarajevo  thus the bridge  uniting the 
two parts of the sarajevo road  linked the town with its surrounding 
villages  

actually  to say  linked  was just as true as to say that the sun 
rises in the morning so that men may see around them and finish 


   



their daily tasks  and sets in the evening that they may be able to 
sleep and rest from the labours of the day for this great stone bridge  
a rare stiucture of unique beauty  such as many richer and busier 
towns do not possess  there are only two others such as this in the 
whole empire   they used to say in olden times  was the one real and 
permanent crossing in the whole middle and upper course of the 
dnna and an indispensable link on the road between bosnia and 
serbia and further  beyond serbia  with other parts of the turkish 
empire  all the way to stambul  the town and its outskirts were 
only the settlements which always and inevitably grow up around 
an important centre of communications and on either side of great 
and important bridges 

here also in time the houses crowded together and the settlements 
multiplied at both ends of the bridge the town owed its existence 
to the bridge and grew out of it as if from an imperishable root  

in order to see a picture of the town and understand it and its 
relation to the bridge clearly  it must be said that there was another 
bridge in the town and another river  this was the river rzav  with 
a wooden bridge across it  at the very end of the town the rzav 
flows into the dnna  so that the centre and at the same time the 
main part of the town lay on a sandy tongue of land between two 
rivers  the great and the small  which met there and its scattered 
outskirts stretched out from both sides of the bridges  along the 
left bank of the dnna and the right bank of the rzav  it was a town 
on the water but even though another river existed and another 
bndge  the words  on the bridge  never meant on the rzav bridge  
a simple wooden structuie without beauty and without history  
that had no reason for its existence save to serve the townspeople 
and their animals as a crossing  but only and uniquely the stone 
bridge over the dnna  

the bridge was about two hundred and fifty paces long and about 
ten paces wide save in the middle where it widened out into two 
completely equal terraces placed symmetncally on either side of the 
roadway and making it twice its normal width  this was the part 
of the bridge known as the kapia  two buttresses had been built 
on each side of the central pier which had been splayed out towards 
the top  so that to right and left of the roadway there were two 
terraces daringly and harmoniously projecting outwards from the 
straight hne of the bridge over the noisy green waters far below  
the two terraces were about five paces long and the same in width 
and were bordered  as was the whole length of the bridge  by a stone 
parapet otherwise  they were open and uncovered  that on the right 
as one came from the town was called the sofa  it was raised by 

h 



two steps and bordered by benches for which the parapet served as 
a back  steps  benches and parapet were all made of the same shining 
stone that on the left  opposite the sola  was similar but without 
benches in the middle of the parapet  the stone rose higher than a 
man and in it  near the top  was inserted a plaque of white marble 
with a rich turkish inscription  a tank  with a carved chronogram 
which told m thirteen verses the name of the man who built the 
bridge and the year m which it was built  near the foot of this stone 
was a fountain  a thin stream of water flowing from the mouth of 
a stone snake  on this part of the terrace a coffee maker had installed 
himself with his copper vessels and turkish cups and ever lighted 
charcoal brazier  and an apprentice who took the coffee over the 
way to the guests on the sola such was the kapia  

on the bridge and its kapia  about it or in connection with it  
flowed and developed  as we shall see  the life of the townsmen  in 
all tales about personal  family or public events the words  on the 
bridge  could always be heard indeed on the bridge over the drina 
were the first steps of childhood and the first games of boyhood 
the christian children  born on the left bank of the dnna  crossed 
the bridge at once in the first days of their lives  for they were always 
taken across in their first week to be christened but all the other 
children  those who were born on the right bank and the moslem 
children who were not christened at all  passed  as had once their 
fathers and their grandfathers  the mam part of their childhood on 
or around the bridge they fished around it or hunted doves under 
its arches from their very earliest years  their eyes grew accustomed 
to the lovely lines of this great stone structure built of shining porous 
stone  regularly and faultlessly cut  they knew all the bosses and 
concavities of the masons  as well as all the tales and legends 
associated with the existence and building of the bridge  m which 
reality and imagination  waking and dream  were wonderfully and 
inextncably mingled  they had always known these things as if 
they had come into the world with them  even as they knew their 
prayers  but could not remember from whom they had learnt them 
nor when they had first heard them  

they knew that the bridge had been built by the grand vezir  
mehmed pasha  who had been born in the nearby village of soko  
lovi  i  just on the far side of one of those mountains which encircled 
the bridge and the town  only a vezir could have given all that was 
needed to build this lasting wonder of stone  a vezir  to the children s 
minds that was something fabulous  immense  terrible and far from 
clear   it was built by rade the mason  who must have lived for 
hundreds of years to have been able to build all that was lovely 


   



and lasting in the serbian lands  that legendary and in fact nameless 
master whom all people desire and dream of  since they do not want 
to have to remember or be indebted to too many  even m memory  
they knew that the vile of the boatmen had hindered its building  as 
always and everywhere there is someone to hinder building  destroy  
ing by night what had been built by day  until  something  had 
whispered from the waters and counselled rade the mason to find 
two infant children  twins  brother and sister  named stoja and 
ostoja  and wall them into the central pier of the bridge  a reward 
was promised to whoever found them and brought them hither  

at last the guards found such twins  still at the breast  in a distant 
village and the vezir s men took them away by force  but when they 
were taking them away  their mother would not be parted from them 
and  weeping and wailing  msensible to blows and to curses  
stumbled after them as far as visegrad itself  where she succeeded in 
forcing her way to rade the mason  

the children were walled into the pier  for it could not be other  
wise  but rade  they say  had pity on them and left openings in the 
pier through which the unhappy mother could feed her sacrificed 
children  those are the finely carved blind windows  narrow as loop  
holes  in which the wild doves now nest  in memory of that  the 
mother s milk has flowed from those walls for hundreds of years 
that is the thin white stream which  at certain times of year  flows 
from that faultless masonry and leaves an indelible mark on the 
stone   the idea of woman s milk stirs in the childish mind a feeling 
at once too intimate and too close  yet at the same time vague and 
mysterious like vezirs and masons  which disturbs and repulses 
them   men scrape those milky traces off the piers and sell them as 
medicinal powder to women who have no milk after giving birth  

in the central pier of the bridge  below the kapia  there is a larger 
opening  a long narrow gateway without gates  like a gigantic loop  
hole  in that pier  they say  is a great room  a gloomy hall  in w hich 
a black arab lives  all the children know this  in their dreams and in 
their fancies he plays a great role  if he should appear to anyone  that 
man must die  not a single child has seen him yet  for children do not 
die  but hamid  the asthmatic porter  with bloodshot eyes  con  
tinually drunk or suffering from a hangover  saw him one night and 
that very same night he died  over there by the wall  it is true that he 
was blind drunk at the time and passed the night on the bridge under 
the open sky in a temperature of   i  c  the children used to gaze 
from the bank into that dark opening as into a gulf which is both 
terrible and fascinating  they would agree to look at it without blink  
ing and whoever first saw anything should cry out open mouthed 

i  



they would peer into that deep dark hole  quivering with curiosity 
and fear  until it seemed to some anaemic child that the opening be  
gan to sway and to move like a black curtain  or until one of them  
mocking and inconsiderate  there is always at least one such   
shouted the arab  and pretended to run away  that spoilt the game 
and aroused disillusion and indignation amongst those who loved 
the play of imagination  hated irony and believed that by looking 
intently they could actually see and feel something at night  in their 
sleep  many of them would toss and fight with the arab from the 
bridge as with fate until their mother woke them and so freed them 
from this nightmare then she would give them cold water to drink 
 to chase away the fear  and make them say the name of god  and 
the child  overtaxed with daytime childish games  would fall asleep 
again into the deep sleep of childhood where terrors can no longer 
take shape or last for long 

up river from the bridge  in the steep banks of grey chalk  on both 
sides of the river  can be seen rounded hollows  always in pairs at 
regular intervals  as if cut in the stone were the hoofpnnts of some 
horse of supernatural size  they led downwards from the old fort  
ress  descended the scarp towards the river and then appeared again 
on the farther bank  where they were lost m the dark earth and 
undergrowth 

the children who fished for tiddlers all day in the summer along 
these stony banks knew that these were hoofpnnts of ancient days 
and long dead warriors  great heroes lived on earth in those days  
when the stone had not yet hardened and was soft as the earth and 
the horses  like the warriors  were of colossal growth only for the 
serbian children these were the prints of the hooves of sarac  the 
horse of kraljevid marko  which had remained there from the time 
when kraljevid marko himself was in prison up there in the old fort  
ress and escaped  flying down the slope and leaping the drina  for at 
that time there was no bridge  but the turkish children knew that it 
had not been kraljevid marko  nor could it have been  for whence 
could a bastard christian dog have had such strength or such a 
horse   any but djerzelez alija on his winged charger which  as 
everyone knew  despised ferries and ferrymen and leapt over rivers 
as if they were watercourses  they did not even squabble about this  
so convinced were both sides in their own belief  and there was never 
an instance of any one of them being able to convince another  or 
that any one had changed his belief  

in these depressions which were round and as wide and deep as 
rather large soup bowls  water still remained long after rain  as 
though in stone vessels the children called these pits  filled with 


   



tepid rainwater  wells and  without distinction of faith  kept the 
tiddlers there which they caught on their lines 

on the left bank  standing alone  immediately above the road  
there was a fairly large earthen barrow  formed of some kind of hard 
earth  grey and almost like stone on it nothing grew or blossomed 
save some short grass  hard and prickly as barbed wire that tumulus 
was the end and frontier of all the childien s games around the 
bridge that was the spot which at one time was called radisav s 
tomb  they used to tell that he was some sort of serbian hei o  a man 
of power  when the vezir  mehmed pasha  had first thought of 
building the bridge on the drina and sent his men here  everyone sub  
mitted and was summoned to forced labour  only this man  radisav  
stirred up the people to revolt and told the vezir not to continue with 
this work for he would meet with great difficulties in building a bridge 
across the dnna  and the vezir had many troubles before he suc  
ceeded m overcoming radisav for he was a man greater than other 
men  there was no rifle or sword that could harm him  nor was there 
rope or chain that could bind him  he broke all of them like thread  
so great was the power of the talisman that he had with him and 
who knows what might have happened and whether the vezir would 
ever have been able to build the bridge  had he not found some of 
his men who were wise and skilful  who bribed and questioned 
radisav s servant  then they took radisav by surprise and di owned 
him while he was asleep  binding him with silken ropes for against 
silk his talisman could not help him the serbian women believe that 
there is one night of the year when a strong white light can be seen 
falling on that tumulus direct from heaven  and that takes place 
sometime m autumn between the greater and lesser feasts of the 
virgin  but the children who  torn between belief and unbelief  re  
mained on vigil by the windows overlooking radisav s tomb have 
never managed to see this heavenly fire  for they were all overcome 
by sleep before midnight came  but there had been travellers  who 
knew nothing of this  who had seen a white light falling on the 
tumulus above the bridge as they returned to the town by night  

the turks in the town  on the other hand  have long told that on 
that spot a certain dervish  by name sheik turhanija  died as a 
martyr to the faith  he was a great hero and defended on this spot 
the crossing of the drina against an infidel army  and that on this 
spot there is neither memorial nor tomb  for such was the wish of the 
dervish himself  for he wanted to be buried vnthout mark or sign  so 
that no one should know who was there  for  if ever again some in  
fidel army should invade by this route  then he would arise from 
under his tumulus and hold them in check  as he had once done  so 



that they should be able to advance no farther than the bridge at 
vilegrad  and therefore heaven now and again shed its light upon 
his tomb 

thus the life of the children of the town was played out under 
and about the bridge in innocent games and childish fancies with 
the first years of maturity  when life s cares and struggles and duties 
had already begun  this life was transferred to the bridge itself  right 
to the kapia  where youthful imagination found other food and new 
fields  

at and around the kapia were the first stirrings of love  the first 
passing glances  flirtations and whisperings there too were the first 
deals and bargains  quarrels and reconciliations  meetings and wait  
ings there  on the stone parapet of the bridge  were laid out for sale 
the first cherries and melons  the early morning salep and hot rolls  
there too gathered the beggars  the maimed and the lepers  as well 
as the young and healthy who wanted to see and be seen  and all 
those who had something remarkable to show in produce  clothes or 
weapons there too the elders of the town often sat to discuss public 
matters and common troubles  but even more often young men who 
only knew how to sing and  oke  there  on great occasions or times 
of change  were posted proclamations and public notices  on the 
raised wall below the marble plaque with the turkish inscription 
and above the fountain   but there too  right up to       hung or 
were exposed on stakes the heads of all those who for whatever 
reason had been executed  and executions in that frontier town  
especially in years of unrest  were frequent and in some years  as 
we shall see  almost of daily occurrence  

weddings or funerals could not cross the bridge without stopping 
at the kapia there the wedding guests would usually preen them  
selves and get into their ranks before entenng the market place if 
the times were peaceful and carefree they would hand the plum  
brandy around  sing  dance the kolo and often delay there fai longer 
than they had intended and for funerals  those who earned the bier 
would put it down to rest for a little there on the kapia where the 
dead man had in any case passed a good part of his life  

the kapia was the most important part of the bridge  even as the 
bridge was the most important part of the town  or as a turkish 
traveller  to whom the people of visegrad had been very hospitable  
wrote in his account of his travels   their kapia is the heart of the 
bridge  which is the heart of the town  which must remain in every  
one s heart  it showed that the old masons  who according to the 
old tales had struggled with vilas and every sort of wonder and had 
been compelled to wall up living children  had a feeling not only for 


   



the permanence and beauty of their work but also for the benefit and 
convenience which the most distant generations were to derive from 
it  when one knows well everyday life here in the town and thinks 
it over carefully  then one must say to oneself that there are really 
only a very small number of people in this bosnia of ours who have 
so much pleasure and enjoyment as does each and every townsman 
on the kapia  

naturally winter should not be taken into account  for then only 
whoever was forced to do so would cross the bndge  and then he 
would lengthen his pace and bend his head before the chill wind that 
blew uninterruptedly over the river  then  it was understood  there 
was no loitering on the open terraces of the kapia  but at every other 
time of year the kapia was a real boon for great and small  then 
every citizen could  at any time of day or night  go out to the kapia 
and sit on the sofa  or hang about it on business or in conversation  
suspended some fifteen metres above the green boisterous waters  
this stone sofa floated in space over the water  with dark green hills 
on three sides  the heavens  filled with clouds or stars  above and 
the open view down river like a narrow amphitheatre bounded by 
the dark blue mountains behind  

how many vezirs or rich men are there in the world who could 
indulge their joy or their cares  their moods or their delights in such 
a spot  few  very few  but how many of our townsmen have  in the 
course of centuries and the passage of generations  sat here in the 
dawn or twilight or evening hours and unconsciously measured the 
whole starry vault above  many and many of us have sat there  head 
in hands  leaning on the well cut smooth stone  watching the eternal 
play of light on the mountains and the clouds m the sky  and have 
unravelled the threads of our small town destinies  eternally the 
same yet eternally tangled in some new manner  someone affirmed 
long ago  it is true that he was a foreigner and spoke in jest  that this 
kapia had had an influence on the fate of the town and even on the 
character of its citizens  in those endless sessions  the stranger said  
one must search for the key to the inclination of many of our towns  
men to reflection and dreaming and one of the main re   ons for that 
melancholic serenity for which the inhabicants of the town are 
renowned  

in any case  it cannot be denied that the people of visegrad have 
from olden times been considered  in comparison with the people of 
other towns  as easy going men  prone to pleasure and free with their 
money  their town is well placed  the villages around it are rich and 
fertile  and money  it is true  passes in abundance through visegrad  
but it does not stay there long  if one finds there some thrifty and 



economical citizen without any sort of vices  then he is certainly 
some newcomer  but the waters and the air of visegrad are such that 
his children grow up with open hands and widespread fingers and 
fall victims to the general contagion of the spendthrift and carefree 
life of the town with its motto   another day another gam   

they tell the tale that starina novak  when he felt his strength 
failing and was compelled to give up his role as highwayman in the 
romania mountains  thus taught the young man grujic who was to 
succeed him  

 when you are sitting in ambush look well at the traveller who 
comes if you see that he rides proudly and that he wears a red cor  
selet and silver bosses and white gaiters  then he is from foca  strike 
at once  for he has wealth both on him and in his saddlebags  if you 
see a poorly dressed traveller  with bowed head  hunched on his 
horse as if he were going out to beg  then strike freely  for he is a 
man of rogatica  they are all alike  misers and tight fisted but as full 
of money as a pomegranate but if you see some mad fellow  with 
legs crossed over the saddlebow  beating on a drum and singing at 
the top of his voice  don t strike and do not soil your hands for 
nothing let the rascal go his way he is from visegrad and he has 
nothing  for money does not stick to such men   

all this goes to confirm the opinion of that foreigner but none the 
less it would be hard to say with certainty that this opinion is cor  
rect as in so many other things  here too it is not easy to determine 
what is cause and w hat effect  has the kapia made them what they 
are  or on the contrary was it imagined in their souls and under  
standings and built for them according to their needs and customs  
it is a vain and superfluous question there are no buildings that have 
been built by chance  remote from the human society where they 
have grown and its needs  hopes and understandings  even as there 
are no arbitrary lines and motiveless forms in the work of the 
masons the life and existence of every great  beautiful and useful 
building  as well as its relation to the place where it has been built  
often bears within itself complex and mysterious drama and history  
however  one thing is clear  that between the life of the townsmen 
and that bridge  there existed a centuries old bond  their fates were 
so intertwined that they could not be imagined separately and could 
not be told separately  therefore the story of the foundation and 
destiny of the bridge is at the same time the story of the life of the 
town and of its people  from generation to generation  even as 
through all the tales about the town stretches the line of the stone 
bridge with its eleven arches and the kapia in the middle  like a 
crown

n ow we must go back to the time when there was not even 
a thought of a bridge at that spot  let alone such a bridge 
as this  

perhaps even in those far off times  some traveller pass  
ing this way  tired and drenched  wished that by some miracle this 
wide and turbulent river were bridged  so that he could reach his 
goal more easily and quickly  for there is no doubt that men had 
always  ever since they first travelled here and overcame the ob  
stacles along the way  thought how to make a crossing at this spot  
even as all travellers at all times have dreamed of a good road  safe 
travelling companions and a warm inn only not every wish bears 
fruit  nor has everyone the will and the power to turn his dreams into 
reality  

the first idea of the bridge  which was destined to be realized  
flashed  at first naturally confused and foggy  across the imagination 
of a ten year old boy from the nearby village of sokolovidi  one 
morning in      when he was being taken along the road from his 
village to far off  shining and terrible stambul  

then this same green and awe inspiring drina  this mountain river 
 which often grew angry   clamoured there between barren and 
naked  stony and sandy banks  the town even then existed  but in 
another form and of different dimensions  on the right bank of the 
river  on the crest of a precipitous hill  where now there are ruins  
rose the well preserved old fortress  with widespread fortifications 
dating from the time of the flowering of the bosnian kingdom  with 
casements and ramparts  the work of one of the powerful pavlovid 
nobles  on the slopes below this fortress and under its protection 
stood the christian settlements  mejdan and bikovac  and the 
recently converted turkish hamlet of du     e  down on the level 
ground between the drina and the rzav  where the real town later 
spread  were only the town meadows  with a road running through 
them  beside which was an old fashioned inn and a few huts and 
water mills  


   



where the drina intersected the road was the famous visegrad 
ferry that was a black old fashioned ferryboat and on it a surly  
slow old ferryman called jamak  whom it was harder to summon 
when awake than any other man from the deepest sleep  he was a 
man of giant stature and extraordinary strength  but he had suffered 
in the many wars in which he had won renown  he had only one 
eye  one ear and one leg  the other was wooden  without greeting 
and without a smile  he would moodily ferry across goods and 
passengers in his own good time  but honestly and safely  so that 
tales were told of his reliability and his honesty as often as of his 
slowness and obstinacy he would not talk with the passengers 
whom he took across nor would he touch them  men threw the 
copper coins that they paid for the crossing into the bottom of the 
black boat where they lay all day m the sand and water  and only 
in the evening would the ferryman collect them carelessly in the 
wooden scoop which he used to bale out the boat and take them 
to his hut on the river bank 

the ferry only worked when the current and height of the river 
were normal or a little higher than normal  but as soon as the river 
ran cloudy or rose above certain limits  jamak hauled out his clumsy 
bark  moored it firmly in a backwater and the drina remained as 
impassable as the greatest of oceans jamak then became deaf even 
in his one sound ear or simply went up to the fortress to work in his 
field then  all day long  there could be seen travellers coming from 
bosnia who stood on the farther bank in desperation  frozen and 
drenched  vainly watching the ferry and the ferryman and from 
time to time yelling long drawn summonses  

c  o o o o    jama a a k     

no one would reply and no one would appear until the waters 
fell  and that moment was decided by jamak himself  dark and unre  
lenting  without discussion or explanation  

the town  which was then little more than a hamlet  stood on the 
right bank of the drina on the slopes of the steep hill below the ruins 
of the one time fortress  for then it did not have the size and shape 
it was to have later when the bridge was built and communications 
and trade developed  

on that november day a long convoy of laden horses arrived on 
the left back of the river and halted there to spend the night the 
aga of the janissaries  with armed escort  was returning to stambul 
after collecting from the villages of eastern bosnia the appointed 
number of christian children for the blood tribute  

it was already the sixth year since the last collection of this 
tribute of blood  and so this time the choice had been easy and rich  


   



the necessary number of healthy  bright and good looking lads 
between ten and fifteen years old had been found without difficulty  
even though many parents had hidden their children in the forests  
taught them how to appear half witted  clothed them in rags and 
let them get filthy  to avoid the aga s choice some went so far as to 
maim their own children  cutting off one of their fingers with an axe  

the chosen children were laden on to little bosnian horses in a 
long convoy on each horse were two plaited panniers  like those for 
fruit  one on each side  and in every pannier was put a child  each 
with a small bundle and a round cake  the last thing they were to 
take from their parents  homes from these panniers  which 
balanced and creaked in unison  peered out the fresh and frightened 
faces of the kidnapped children  some of them gazed calmly across 
the horses  cruppers  looking as long as they could at their native 
land  others ate and wept at the same time  while others slept with 
heads resting on the pack saddles  

a little way behind the last horses in that strange convoy 
straggled  dishevelled and exhausted  many parents and relatives of 
those children who were being carried away for ever to a foreign 
world  where they would be circumcized  become turkish and  
forgetting their faith  their country and their origin  would pass 
their lives in the ranks of the janissaries or in some other  higher  
service of the empire they were for the most part women  mothers  
grandmothers and sisters of the stolen children  

when they came too close  the aga s horsemen would drive them 
away with whips  urging their horses at them with loud cries to 
allah then they would fly in all directions and hide in the forests 
along the roadsides  only to gather again a little later behind the 
convoy and strive with tear filled eyes to see once again over the 
panniers the heads of the children who were being taken from 
them  the mothers were especially persistent and hard to restrain  
some would rush forward not locking where they were going  with 
bare breasts  and dishevelled hair  forgetting ever hing about them  
wailing and lamenting as at a burial  while others almost out of 
their minds moaned as if their wombs were being tom by birth  
pangs  and blinded with tears ran right on to the horsemen s whips 
and replied to every blow with the fruitless question   where are 
you taking him  why are you taking him from me   some tried to 
speak clearly to their children and to give them some last part of 
themselves  as much as might be said in a couple of words  some 
recommendation or advice for the way 

 rade  my son  don t forget your mother         

 ilija  ilija  ilija   screamed another woman  searching desperately 


   



with her glances for the dear well known head and repeating this 
incessantly as if she wished to carve into the child s memory that 
name which would in a day or two be taken from him forever  

but the way was long  the earth hard  the body weak and the 
osmanlis powerful and pitiless little by little the women dropped 
back exhausted by the march and the blows  and one after the other 
abandoned their vain effort  here  at the vijegrad ferry  even the 
most enduring had to halt for they were not allowed on the ferry 
and were unable to cross the water now they could sit in peace 
on the bank and weep  for no one persecuted them any longer  
there they waited as if turned to stone and sat  insensible to 
hunger  thirst and cold  until on the farther bank of the river they 
could see once more the long drawn out convoy of horses and 
riders as it moved onward towards dubrina  and tried once more to 
catch a last glimpse of the children who were disappearing from 
their sight  

on that november day in one of those countless panniers a 
dark skinned boy of about ten years old from the mountain village 
of sokolovidi sat silent and looked about him with dry eyes in a 
chilled and reddened hand he held a small curved knife with which 
he absent mindedly whittled at the edges of his pannier  but at the 
same time looked about him he was to remember that stony bank 
overgrown with sparse  bare and dull grey willows  the surly ferry  
man and the dry water mill full of draughts and spiders  webs 
where they had to spend the night before it was possible to transport 
all of them across the troubled waters of the drina over which the 
ravens were croaking somewhere within himself he felt a sharp 
stabbing pain which from time to time seemed suddenly to cut his 
chest in two and hurt terribly  which was always associated with 
the memory of that place where the road broke off  where desola  
tion and despair were extinguished and remained on the stony 
banks of the river  across which the passage was so difficult  so 
expensive and so unsafe  it was here  at this particularly painful 
spot in that hilly and poverty stricken district  in which misfortune 
was open and evident  that man was halted by powers stronger 
than he and  ashamed of his powerlessness  was forced to recognize 
more clearly his own misery and that of others  his own backward  
ness and that of others  

all this was summed up in that physical discomfort that the boy 
felt on that november day and which never completely left him  
though he changed his way of life  his faith  his name and his 
country  

what this boy in the pannier was later to become has been told 



in all histories in all languages and is better known in the world 
outside than it is amongst us in time he became a young and 
brave officer at the sultan s court  then great admiral of the fleet  
then the sultan s son in law  a general and statesman of world 
renown  mehmed pasha sokolli  who waged wars that were for the 
most part victorious on three continents and extended the frontiers 
of the ottoman empire  making it safe abroad and by good adminis  
tration consolidated it from wiihin for these sixty odd years he 
served three sultans  experienced both good and evil as only rare 
and chosen persons may experience them  and raised himself to 
heights of power and authority unknown to us  which few men 
reach and few men keep  this new man that he had become in a 
foreign world where we could not follow even in our thoughts  
must have forgotten all that he had left behind in the country 
whence they had once brought him he surely forgot too the cross  
ing of the dnna at visegrad  the bare banks on which travellers 
shivered with cold and uncertainty  the slow and worm eaten ferry  
the strange ferryman  and the hungry ravens above the troubled 
waters  but that feeling of discomfort which had remained in him 
had never completely disappeared on the other hand  with years 
and with age it appeared more and more often  always the same 
black pain which cut into his breast with that special well known 
childhood pang which was clearly distinguishable from all the ills 
and pains that life later brought to him with closed eyes  the 
vezir would wait until that black knife like pang passed and the pain 
diminished in one of those moments he thought that he might be 
able to free himself from this discomfort if he could do away with 
that ferry on the distant drina  around which so much misery and 
inconvenience gathered and increased incessantly  and bridge the 
steep banks and the evil water between them  join the two ends of 
the road which was broken by the drina and thus link safely and for 
ever bosnia and the east  the place of his origin and the places of his 
life  thus it was he who first  in a single moment behind closed 
eyelids  saw the firm graceful silhouette of the great stone bridge 
which was to be built there  

that very same year  by the vezir s order and at the vezir s 
expense  the building of the great bridge on the drina began  it 
lasted five years  that must have been an exceptionally lively and 
important time for the town and the whole district  full of change 
and of events great and small  but for a wonder  in the town which 
remembered for centuries and discussed every sort of event  includ  
ing all those directly connected with the bridge  not many details of 
the commencement of the operation were preserved  


   



the common people remember and tell of what they are able to 
grasp and what they are able to transform into legend  anything 
else passes them by without deeper trace  with the dumb indif  
ference of nameless natural phenomena  which do not touch the 
imagination or remain in the memory  this hard and long building 
process was for them a foreign task undertaken at another s ex  
pense  only when  as the fruit of this effort  the great bridge arose  
men began to remember details and to embroider the creation of a 
real  skilfully built and lasting bridge with fabulous tales which they 
well knew how to weave and to remember  


   



in 




i n the spring of that year when the vezir had made his decision to 
build  his men arrived m the town to prepare everything neces  
sary for the construction work on the bridge there were many 
of them  with horses  carts  various tools and tents all this ex  
cited fear and apprehension in the little town and the surrounding 
villages  especially among the christians  

at the head of this group was abidaga  who was responsible to the 
vezir for building the bridge  with him was the mason  tosun 
effendi   there had already been tales about this abidaga  saying 
that he was a man who stopped at nothing  harsh and pitiless 
beyond measure   as soon as they had settled in their tents below 
mejdan  abidaga summoned the local leaders and all the principal 
turks for a discussion  but there was not much of a discussion  for 
only one man spoke and he was abidaga  those who had been sum  
moned saw a powerfully built man  with green eyes and an un  
healthy reddish face  dressed in nch stambul clothes  with a reddish 
beard and wonderfully upturned moustaches in the magyar fashion  
the speech which this violent man delivered to the notables 
astonished them even more than his appearance   it is more than 
likely that you have heard tales about me even before i came here 
and i know without asking that those tales could not have been 
pleasant or favourable  probably you have heard that i demand 
work and obedience from everyone  and that i will beat and kill 
anyone who does not work as he should and does not obey without 
argument  that i do not know the meaning of  i cannot  or   there 
isn t any   that wherever i am heads will roll at the slightest word  
and that in short i am a bloodthirsty and hard man  i want to tell 
you that those tales are neither imaginary nor exaggerated  under 
my linden tree there is no shade  i have won this reputation over 
long years of service in which i have devotedly carried out the 
orders of the grand vezir  i trust in god that i shall carry out this 
work for which i was sent and when at the completion of the work 
i go hence  i hope that even harsher and darker tales will go before 

   



me than those which have already reached you  

after this unusual introduction to which all listened in silence and 
with downcast eyes  abidaga explained that it was a matter of a 
building of great importance  such as did not exist even in richer 
lands  that the work would last five  perhaps six  years  but that the 
vezir s will would be carried out to the fineness of a hair and 
punctual to a minute  then he laid down his first requirements and 
what he therefore expected from the local turks and demanded 
from the rayah  the christian serfs  

beside him sat tosun effendi  a small  pale  yellowish renegade  
born in the greek islands  a mason who had built many of mehmed 
pasha s bequests in stambul he remained quiet and indifferent  as if 
he were not hearing or did not understand abidaga s speech  he 
gazed at his hands and only looked up from time to time  then they 
could see his big black eyes  beautiful and short sighted eyes with a 
velvety sheen  the eyes of a man who only looks to his work and 
does not see  does not feel and does not understand anything else in 
life or in the world  

the notables filed out of the small stuffy tent  troubled and down  
cast  they felt as if they were sweating under their new ceremonial 
clothes and each one of them felt fear and anxiety taking root in 
him  

a great and incomprehensible disaster had fallen upon the town 
and the whole of the district  a catastrophe whose end could not be 
foreseen  first of all began the felling of the forests and the transport 
of the timber  so great a mass of scaffolding arose on both banks of 
the drina that for long the people thought that the bridge would be 
built of wood  then the earthworks began  the excavations  the 
revetting of the chalky banks  these were mostly carried out by 
forced labour  so everything went on until the late autumn  when 
work was temporarily stopped and the first part of the construction 
completed  

all this was carried out under abidaga s supervision and that of 
his long green staff which has passed into legend  whomever he 
pointed at with this staff  having noticed that he was malingering or 
not working as he should  the guards seized  they beat him on the 
spot and then poured water over his bleeding and unconscious 
body and sent him back to work again  when in late autumn 
abidaga left the town  he again sent for the notables and told them 
that he was going away to another place for the winter  but that his 
eye would still be on them  all would be responsible for everything  
if it were found that any part of the work had been damaged  
if a single stick were missing from the scaffolding  he would fine the 


   



whole town when they ventured to say that damage might be 
caused by floods  he replied coldly and without hesitation that this 
was their district and the river too was theirs as well as whatever 
damage it might cause 

all the winter the townsmen guarded the material and watched 
the construction works like the eyes in their head  and when with 
the spring abidaga once again appeared  with tosun effendi  there 
came with them dalmatian stone masons  whom the people called 
 latin masters  at first there were about thirty of them  led by a 
certain mastro antonio  a christian from ulcinj he was a tall  
handsome man of keen eye  bold glance and hooked nose  with fair 
hair falling to his shoulders and dressed like a noble in the western 
manner his assistant was a negro  a real negro  a young and merry 
man whom the whole town and all the workmen soon nicknamed 
 the arab  

if in the previous year  judging from the mass of scaffolding  it 
seemed as if abidaga had intended to build the bridge of wood  it 
now seemed to everyone that he wanted to build a new stambul 
here on the drina  then began the hauling of stone from the 
quarries which had already been opened up in the hills near banja  
an hour s walk from the town  

next year a most unusual spring broke near the visegrad ferry  
besides all that which sprang up and flowered every year at that 
time  there arose out of the earth a whole settlement of huts  new 
roads made their appearance and new approaches to the water s 
edge countless oxcarts and packhorses swarmed on all sides  the 
men from mejdan and okoliste saw how every day  like a sort of 
harvest  there grew there by the river a restless swarm of men  
beasts and building material of every kind  

on the steep banks worked the master stone masons  the whole 
area took on a sort of yellowish colour from the stone dust  and a 
little farther along  on the sandy plain  local workers were slaking 
lime and moving  ragged and pale  through the white smoke which 
rose high from the kilns  the roads were tom to pieces by the 
overloaded carts  the ferry worked all day  taking from one bank 
to the other building material  overseers and workmen  wading in 
the spring waters up to their waists  special workmen drove in piles 
and stakes and put in position gabions filled with clay  intended to 
break the current  

all this was watched by those who up till then had lived peace  
fully in their scattered houses on the slopes near the drina ferry  
and it would have been well for them had they been able only to 
watch  but the work soon became so extensive and its impetus so 


   



great that it drew into the whirlpool everything alive or dead  not 
only in the town but also from great distances away  with the 
second year the number of workers had grown to such an extent 
that they equalled all the male inhabitants of the town  all carts  
all horses and oxen worked only for the bridge  everything that 
could creep or roll was taken and pressed into service  sometimes 
paid but sometimes by force  there was more money than before  
but high prices and shortages increased more rapidly than the money 
flowed in  so that when it reached men s hands it was already half 
eaten away  even worse than the rise in prices and the shortages 
was the unrest  disorder and insecurity which now enveloped the 
town as a consequence of the incursion of so many workmen from 
the outer world  despite all abidaga s severity  there were frequent 
clashes among the workers  and many thefts from the gardens and 
courtyards  the moslem women had to keep their faces veiled even 
when they went into their own yards  for the gaze of the countless 
workers  local and foreign  might come from anywhere and the 
turks of the town kept the practices of islam very strictly  the 
more so since they were all recently converted and there was 
scarcely one of them who did not remember either a father or a 
grandfather who was a christian or a recently converted turk  
because of this the older persons who followed the law of islam 
were openly indignant and turned their backs on this chaotic mass 
of workers  draft animals  wood  earth and stone which grew ever 
larger and more complicated on both sides of the ferry and which  
in the underpinning operations  broke into their streets  their court  
yards and their gardens  

at first they had all been proud of the great bequest which the 
vezir was to erect in their district  then they had not realized  as 
they now saw with their own eyes  that these glorious buildings 
involved so much disorder and unrest  effort and expense  it was a 
fine thing  they thought  to belong to the pure ruling faith  it was a 
fine thing to have as a countryman the vezir in stambul  and still 
finer to imagine the strong  costly bridge across the river  but what 
was happening now m no way resembled this  their town had been 
turned into a hell  a devil s dance of incomprehensible works  of 
smoke  dust  shouts and tumult  the years passed  the work ex  
tended and grew greater  but there was no end or thought of end to 
be seen  it looked like anything you like  but not a bridge  

so thought the recently converted turks of the town and  in 
private among themselves  avowed that they were fed up to the 
teeth with lordship and pride and future glory and had had more 
than enough of the bridge and the vezir  they only prayed allah to 


   



deliver them from this disaster and restore to them and their homes 
their former peace and the quietness of their humble lives beside the 
old fashioned ferry on the nver  

all this affected the turks  but even more it affected the christian 
rayah of the whole visegrad district  with this difference  that no 
one asked their opinion about anything  nor were they even able to 
express their indignation  it was now the third year since the people 
had been on forced labour for the new bridge  they themselves and 
all their horses and oxen  and that too not only for the local rayah 
but also all those from the nearby districts  everywhere abidaga s 
guards and horsemen seized the rayah from the villages and even 
the towns and drove them away to work on the bridge  usually 
they surprised them while sleeping and pinioned them like chickens 
through all bosnia  traveller told traveller not to go to the drina  
for whoever went there was seized  without question of who or 
what he was or where he was going  and was forced to work for at 
least a few days  the young men in the villages tried to run away 
into the forests  but the guards took hostages from their houses  
often women  in place of those who fled  

this was the third autumn that the people had been forced to 
labour on the bridge and in no way could it be seen that the work 
was progressing or that the end of their misfortune was in sight  
autumn was already in full spate  the roads were breaking up from 
the rams  the drina was rising and troubled  and the bare stubble 
full of slow winged ravens  but abidaga did not halt the work  
under the wan november sun the peasants dragged wood and stone  
waded with bare feet or in sandals of freshly slaughtered hide along 
the muddy roads  sweating with strain or chilled by the wind  
folding around themselves cloaks full of new holes and old patches  
and knotting up the ragged ends of their single shirts of coarse linen  
blackened by ram  mud and smoke  which they dared not wash lest 
they fall to pieces in the water  over all of them hovered abidaga s 
green staff  for abidaga visited both the quarries at banja and the 
works around the bridge several times each day  he was filled with 
rage and fury against the whole world because the days were 
growing shorter and the work had not progressed as quickly as he 
wished  in a heavy surcoat of russian fur and high boots  he climbed  
with red congested face  over the scaffolding of such piers as already 
arose from the waters  visited forges  barracks and workers  huts 
and swore at everyone he came across  overseers and contractors 
alike  

the days are short  always shorter  you sons of bitches  you are 
eating your bread for nothing   


   



he burst out in fury  as if they were to blame because it dawned 
late and darkened early before twilight  that relentless and implac  
able visegrad twilight  when the steep hills seemed to close in over 
the town and each night fell quickly  as heavy and deaf as the last  
abidaga s fury rose to its height  and having no one left on whom 
to vent his wrath  he turned it on himself and could not sleep for 
thinking of so much work not being done and so many people 
malingering and wasting time  he ground his teeth  he summoned 
the overseers and worked out how  from then on  it would be pos  
sible to make better use of the daylight and exploit the workers more 
effectively  

the people were sleeping in their huts and stables  resting and 
restoring their forces but all did not sleep  they too knew how to 
keep vigil  to their own profit and in their own manner  in a dry 
and spacious stable a fire was burning  or more exactly had been 
burning  for now only a few embers glowing in the half lit space 
remained the whole stable was filled with smoke and the heavy  
sour smell of wet clothes and sandals and the exhalations of about 
thirteen human bodies they were all pressed men  peasants from 
the neighbourhood  christian rayah  all were muddy and wet 
through  exhausted and careworn they resented this unpaid and 
pointless forced labour while up there in the villages their fields 
awaited the autumn ploughing in vain  the greater number were 
still awake they were drying their gaiters by the fire  plaiting 
sandals or only gazing at the embers  amongst them was a certain 
montenegrin  no one knew from where  whom the guards had 
seized on the road and had pressed for labour for several days  
though he kept telling them and proving to them how wearisome 
and hard this work was for him and how his honour could not 
endure this work for slaves  

most of the wakeful peasants  especially the younger ones  gathered 
around him  from the deep pocket of his cloak the montenegrin 
drew out a gusle  a tiny primitive fiddle  clumsy and as small as 
the palm of a man s hand  and a short bow  one of the peasants 
went outside and mounted guard before the stable lest some turk 
should chance to come along  all looked at the montenegrin as if 
they saw him for the first time and at the gusle which seemed to 
disappear in his huge hands  he bent over  the gusle in his lap  and 
pressed its head under his chin  greased the string with resin and 
breathed heavily on the bow  everything was moist and slack  
while he occupied himself with these petty tasks  calmly and self  
confidently as if he were alone in the world  they all looked at him 
without a movement  at last the first notes wailed out  sharp and 


b 


   



uneven the excitement rose the montenegrin found the key and 
began to sing thiough his nose and accompany himself with the 
gusle everyone was intent  awaiting the w onderful tale then  
suddenly  after he had more or less attuned his voice to the gusle  
the montenegrin threw back his head proudly and violently so that 
his adam s apple stood out m his scrawny neck and his sharp profile 
was outlined in the firelight  and sang in a strangled and constrained 
voice  a a a a  a a a a  and then all at once in a clear and ringing 
tone  

the serbian tsar stefan 
drank wine m fertile prizren  

by him sat the old patriarchs  

foui of them  the old patriarchs  

next them were nine bishops 

and a score of three tailed vezirs 

and the ranks of serbian nobles 

wine was served by michael the cup bearer 

and on the breast of his sister kandosia 

shone the light of precious stones     

the peasants pressed closer and closer around the singer but with  
out making the slightest noise  their very breathing could be heard  
they half closed their eyes  carried away with wonder thrills ran 
up and down their spines  their backs straigntened up  their breasts 
expanded  their eyes shone  their fingers opened and shut and their 
jaw muscles tightened  the montenegrin developed his melody more 
and more rapidly  even more beautiful and bolder  while the wet 
and sleepless workmen  earned away and insensible to all else  fol  
lowed the tale as if it were their own more beautiful and more 
glorious destiny  

among the countless peasants pressed for hard labour was a cer  
tain radisav from uniste  a small village quite close to the town  
he was a smallish man  dark faced  with restless eyes  a little bent  
and walked quickly  spreading out his legs and moving his head and 
shoulders from left to right  right to left  as if sowing wheat  he was 
not as poor as he appeared to be  nor as simple as he made himself 
out  his family were known as the heraci  they had good land and 
there were many males in the house  but almost the whole village 
had been converted to islam over the past forty years so that they 
were lonely and isolated  this small  bowed radisav had been 
scurrying about from one stable to the next these autumn nights 
 sowing  revolt and had insinuated himself among the peasants like 
an eel  whispering and counselling with one only at a time  what he 
said was roughly this  

 brother  we have had enough of this  we must defend ourselves  

   



you can see for yourself that this building work will be the death of 
all of us  it will eat us all up  even our children will have to do forced 
labour on the bridge  if there are any of us left  for us this work 
means extermination and nothing less  a bridge is no good to the 
poor and to the rayah  but only for the turks  we can neither raise 
armies nor carry on trade  for us the ferry is more than enough so a 
few of us have agreed among ourselves to go by night  at the darkest 
hour  and break down and spoil as much as possible of what has been 
done  and to spread the rumour that it is a vila  a fairy  who is de  
stroying the works at the bridge and who does not want any bridge 
over the drina  we shall see if this will be of any help  we have no 
other way and something must be done   

there were  as always  some who were fainthearted and un  
reliable  who thought this to be a sterile idea  since the cunning and 
powerful turks would not be turned away from their intention they 
would have to do forced labour even longer since god so willed  they 
should not make bad worse  but there were also those who felt that 
anything was better than to go on slaving and to wait until even the 
last rag of clothing fell from a man and the last ounce of strength be 
wasted by the heavy labour and abidaga s short commons  and that 
they must follow anyone who was willing to go to extremes  these 
were for the most part young men  but there were also serious mar  
ried men  with families  who agreed  though without enthusiasm or 
fire  and who said worriedly  

 come and let s break it down  may his blood eat him up before he 
eats us up and if that does not help        

and at that point they waved their hands in desperate resolution  

so in these first autumn days the rumour began to spread  first 
among the workers and then in the town itself  that the vila of the 
waters had intervened in the work on the bridge  that she destroyed 
and pulled down overnight what had been built by day and that the 
whole scheme would come to nothing  at the same time  inex  
plicable damage began to appear over night in the revetments and 
even in the masonry itself the tools which the masons had up till 
then left on the piers began to get lost and disappear  the revetments 
to break down and be carried away by the waters  

the rumour that the bridge would never be finished spread far 
afield  both turks and christians spread it and little by little it took 
form as a firm belief  the christian rayah were jubilant  whispering 
it stealthily and soundlessly but from a full heart  the local turks  
who had earlier looked on the vezir s building work with pride  be  
gan to wink disdainfully and wave their hands  many of the con  
verted turks who  in changing faith  had not found what they had 

   



hoped for  but had continued to sit down to a meagre supper and go 
about with patched elbows  heard the rumour and repeated with en  
joyment the story of the great lack of success and found some sort of 
proud satisfaction in the thought that not e en vezirs could carry 
out everything they had a mind to do it was alreadj  being said that 
the foreign maestri weie preparing to lea e and that theie would be 
no bridge there where no bridge had ever been befoie and where it 
should never have been begun all these tales blended and spread 
quickly  

the common people easily make up fables and spread them 
quickly  wherein reality is strangely and inextricably mixed and 
interwoven with legend the peasants who listened at night to the 
gusle player said that the vila who was destroying the bridge had 
told abidaga that she would not cease her work of destruction until 
twin children  stoja and ostoja by name  should be walled into the 
foundations  many swore that they had seen the guards who were 
searching for such a pair of children in the villages  the guards were 
indeed going around the villages but they were not looking for chil  
dren but listening for rumours and interrogating the people in order 
to try and find out who were those unknown persons who were de  
stroying the bndge   

a short time before  it had happened that in a village above 
visegrad a poor stuttering half witted girl  who was a servant  be  
came pregnant  she herself would not say  or could not say  by 
whom  it was a rare and almost unheard of event that a girl  and such 
a girl  should conceive and still more so that the father should remain 
unknown  the story was noised far abroad  in good time the girl gave 
birth  in some stable or other  to twins  both stillborn  the women 
from the village who helped her at the birth  which was exception  
ally difficult  at once buned the children in a plum orchard  but on 
the third day after  the unfortunate mother got up and began to look 
for her children everywhere in the village  in vain they explained to 
her that the children had been born dead and had been buried 
finally  in order to be rid of her incessant questionings  they told 
her  or rather explained to her by gestures  that her children had been 
taken away to the town  down there where the turks were building 
the bridge  weak and distraught  she wandered down into the town 
and began to range around the ferry and the construction works  
looking fearfully into the eyes of the men there and asking in incom  
prehensible stutterings for her children  the men looked at her in 
amazement or drove her away so that she should not hinder them at 
their work  seeing that they did not understand what she wanted  she 
unbuttoned her coarse peasant shift and showed them her breasts  

   



painful and swollen  on which the nipples had already begun to 
crack and showed all bloody from the milk that flowed from them 
irresistibly no one know how to help her and explain to her that 
her children had not been walled up in the bridge  for to all kind 
words and assurances  curses and threats  she only stuttered miser  
ably and with sharp distrustful glances peered into every corner  
finally they gave up persecuting her and allowed her to wander 
about the construction work  avoiding her with a sorrowful com  
passion the cooks gave her some of the workers  porridge which 
had got burnt at the bottom of the cauldrons  they called her mad 
ilinka and  after them  the whole town did so even abidaga himself 
passed by her without cursing her  turning his head away super  
stitiously  and ordered that she be given alms  so she went on living 
there  a harmless idiot  by the construction works and because of 
her the story remained that the turks had walled her children into 
the bridge some believed it and others not  but none the less it was 
repeated all the more and noised afar 

meanwhile the damage went on  now less now more  and parallel 
with it the rumours spread even more obstinately that the vilas 
would not permit a bridge to be built across the drina  

abidaga was furious it enraged him that anyone could be found 
who dared to undertake anything against his work or his intentions 
despite his proverbial harshness which he cultivated as a special sub  
ject for pride also all these people disgusted him  the moslems as 
much as the christians  slow and unskilled in their work  they were 
quick enough for raillery and lack of respect and knew only too well 
how to find mocking and corrosive words for everything they did 
not understand or did not know how to do he posted guards on 
both banks of the river the damage to the earthworks then ceased  
but damage to the construction work in the river itself continued  
only on moonlit nights was there no damage  that confirmed 
abidaga  who did not believe in the vila  in his belief that this parti  
cular vila was not invisible and did not descend from on high  for a 
long time he would not  or could not  believe those who said it was 
due to peasant cunning  but now he was convinced that that was 
exactly what it was and that excited him to still greater fury but 
he none the less knew that he must appear calm and hide his fury if 
he wanted to snare these pests and finish once and for all with these 
tales about vilas and about stopping work on the bridge  which 
might become dangerous  he summoned the chief of the guards  a 
certain man from plevlje  who had grown up in stambul  a pale and 
unhealthy man  

the two men were instinctively hostile to one another  but at the  

   



same time were continually drawn together and came into conflict  
between them incomprehensible feelings of hatred  repulsion  fear 
and distrust were woven permanently  abidaga  who was mild and 
pleasant towards no one  displayed an unconcealed repulsion to  
wards this pale faced renegade all that he did or said drove abidaga 
into a frenzy and provoked him to curse and humiliate him  but the 
more that the man from plevlje abased himself and was obsequious  
the greater grew abidaga s repulsion from the first day of their 
meeting the leader of the guards was superstitiously and terribly 
afraid of abidaga and this fear became in time an oppressive night  
mare which never left him at every step and movement  often in his 
dreams  he would think  what will abidaga say about this  in vain 
he tried to please him and do what he wished everything that came 
from him abidaga accepted with disdain and that incomprehen  
sible hatred hampered and disconcerted the man from plevlje and 
made him still stiffer and clumsier  he believed that  because of 
abidaga  he would one day lose not only his job and his position  but 
also his head therefore he lived in a state of permanent agitation 
and passed from dull discouragement to a feverish and cruel zeal 
when now  pale and stiff  he stood before abidaga  the latter spoke 
to him in a voice hoarse with anger  

 listen  blockhead  you are clever with these sons of sows  you 
know their language and all their monkey tricks  yet for all that you 
are incapable of finding out what scab it is who has dared to spoil the 
vezir s work  that is because you are a scab yourself  the same as 
they are  and the only worse scab is whoever made you leader and 
a chief and has found nobody to reward you as you deserve  so i will 
do so  since there is no other  know that i will put you under the 
earth so that you will not throw as much shadow as even the tiniest 
blade of grass  if all damage to the works does not cease within three 
days  if you do not catch whoever is doing this and do not put an 
end to all these silly stories about vilas and about stopping the work  
then i will put you living on a stake on the highest part of the staging  
that all may see you and take fright and get some sense into then  
heads  i swear this by my life and my faith  which i do not swear by 
lightly  today is thursday  you have till sunday  now go to the 
devil who sent you to me  go  march   

even without this oath the man from plevlje would have believed 
abidaga s threat  for even in his dreams he used to shudder at his 
words and at his glance  now he went out in one of his fits of panic  
stricken terror and at once set desperately to work  he summoned 
his own men and  passing suddenly from dull torpor to mad rage  he 
began to curse them  


   



 blind good for nothings   raged the man from plevlje  as if he 
were already placed alive upon the stake and yelling in the face of 
each of the guards   is it thus that you keep watch and look after the 
sultan s interests  you are quick and lively enough when you go to 
the cooking pots  but when you are on duty your legs are leaden and 
your wits are dull  my face burns because of you but you will do no 
more slacking in my employ  i will massacre all of you  not a single 
one of you will keep his head on his shoulders if in two days this busi  
ness does not end and if you do not seize and kill these bastards you 
have still two days to live  i swear it by my faith and the koran   

he went on shouting in this way for a long time  then  not know  
ing what else to say to them or with what more to threaten them  he 
spat at them one by one  but when he had played himself out and 
freed himself from the pressure of his fear  which had taken the 
form of rage  he set to work at once with desperate energy he spent 
the night cruising up and down the banks with his men at one time 
during the night it seemed to them that something was knocking at 
that part of the staging which was farthest out in the river and they 
rushed thither  they heard a plank crack and a stone fall into the 
river  but when they got to the spot they indeed found some broken 
scaffolding and a part of the masonry torn away but no trace of the 
miscreants faced with that ghostly emptiness the guards shivered 
fi om superstitious fright and from the darkness and moisture of the 
night they called to one another  peered into the blackness  waved 
lighted torches  but all in vain the damage had been done again  and 
they who had done it had not been caught and killed  as though in 
very truth they were invisible  

the next night the man from plevlje arranged his ambush better  
he sent some of his men over to the farther bank also and when night 
fell he hid guards in the scaffolding right out to the end and he him  
self with two others sat in a boat which he had drawn unnoticed in 
the darkness to the left bank  thence in a few strokes they could be 
at one of the two piers on which construction had begun  in this way 
he could fall on the miscreants from two sides  so that they could not 
escape unless they had wings or could go under water  

all that long cold night the man from plevlje lay in the boat 
covered with sheepskins  tormented by the dark thoughts whirling 
in his head  would abidaga really carry out his threat and take his 
life which  under such a chief  was in any case no life but only terror 
and torment  but along the whole of the construction works not a 
murmur could be heard except the monotonous lapping and lisping 
of the unseen waters  thus it dawned and the man from plevlje felt 
in all his stiffened body that his life was darkening and shortening  


   



on the next  the third and last night  there was the same vigil  the 
same arrangements  the same fearful listening midnight passed the 
man from plevlje was seized with a mortal apathy then he heard a 
slight splash and then  louder  a blow on the oak beams which were 
placed in the river and on which the staging rested there was a sharp 
whistle  but the leader s boat had already moved standing upright  
he peered into the darkness  waving his hands and shouting in a 
hoarse voice  

 row  row 

the men  half awake  rowed vigorously  but a strong current 
caught the boat earlier than it should have instead of reaching the 
staging  the boat turned down river they were unable to make way 
against the current and it would have swept them far away had not 
something unexpectedly checked them  

there  right in the middle of the main current  where there were 
neither beams nor scaffolding  their boat struck something heavy 
and wooden which echoed dully only then did they realize that on 
the scaffolding above them the guards were struggling with some  
thing the guards  local renegades  were all shouting at once  they 
fell over one another in the darkness in a medley of broken and in  
comprehensible cries  

 hold there  don t let go   

 hey  fellows  here   

 it s me         

between the shouts some heavy object or human body could be 
heard splashing into the water  

the man from plevlje was for some moments uncertain where he 
was or what was happening  but as soon as he had come to his senses 
he began to pull with an iron hook at the end of a long pole at the 
beams on which his boat had struck and succeeded in pulling the 
boat upstream nearer and nearer the scaffolding soon he was up to 
the oak piles and  taking heart  shouted at the top of his voice  

 lights  light a torch there  throw me a rope   

at first no one answered   then  after much shouting  in which no 
one listened to or could understand anyone else  a weak torch glim  
mered uncertainly and fitfully above this first spark of light only 
confused the eyes even more and mingled in an uneasy whirl  men  
things and their shadows with the red reflections on the water  but 
then another torch flamed in another hand  the light steadied and 
men began to pull themselves together and recognize one another  
soon everything became clear and explicable  

between the boat of the man from plevlje and the scaffolding lay 
a small raft made of only three planks  at the front was an oar  a real 


   



raftsman s oar  only shorter and weaker  the raft was moored with 
a bark cord to one of the beams under the scaffolding and was held 
thus against the swift waters which splashed about it and tried with 
all their force to pull it away downstream  the guards on the staging 
helped their leader to cross the raft and climb up to them all were 
haggard and out of breath  on the planks a christian peasant was 
lying his breast was heaving quickly and violently and his eyes  
starting out of his head  showed fear stricken whites 

the oldest of the four guards explained to their excited leader that 
they had been keeping watch at various points on the staging  when 
they heard the sound of oars in the darkness  they had thought it was 
their leader s boat  but they had been clever enough not to show 
themselves and to wait and see what would happen  then they saw 
two peasants who approached the piers and with some difficulty 
moored their raft to one of them they let them climb up and come 
among them and then they attacked them with axes  overcame them 
and bound them one  who had been struck unconscious by a blow 
from an axe  they had bound easily  but the other one  after pretend  
ing to be half dead  had slipped from their grasp like a fish through 
the planks into the water the frightened guard halted in his story 
and the man from plevlje screamed  

 who let him go  tell me who let him go  or i shall chop you all 
into small pieces  all of you   

the men stood silently and blinked at the red flickering light while 
then leader kept turning around as if searching the darkness  and 
shouting insults at them such as they had never heard him use by 
day then  suddenly  he started  leant over the bound peasant as if 
over a precious hoard  and began to mutter through his teeth in a 
thin lachrymose voice  

 guard him  guard him well  you bastards  if you let him go  not a 
single one of you will keep his head on his shoulders   

the guards crowded round the peasant two more hurried to join 
them  crossing the ferry from the farther bank the man from 
plevlje ordered them to bind the prisoner more securely  so they car  
ried him like a corpse slowly and carefully to the bank  the man 
from plevlje went with them  not looking where he was treading and 
never taking his eyes from the bound man it seemed to him that he 
was growing in stature with every step  that only from that moment 
was he beginning to live  

on the bank new torches were lighted and began to flare up the 
captive peasant was taken into one of the workmen s barracks where 
there was a fire  and was bound tightly to a post with ropes and 
chains taken from the hearth  


    



it was radisav of uniste himself  

the man from plevlje calmed down a little  he no longer screamed 
or swore  but he was unable to keep still  he sent guards along the 
banks to look for the other peasant who had leapt into the water  
though it was clear that on so dark a night  if he had not drowned  
it would be impossible to find or catch him he gave order after 
order  went out  came in again and then once again went back  
drunk with excitement  he began to interrogate the bound 
peasant  but soon left oft doing that also  all that he did was only to 
master and conceal his nervousness  for in fact he had only one 
thought in his head  he was waiting for abidaga he had not long 
to wait  

as soon as he had slept out his first sleep abidaga  as was his habit  
waked shortly after midnight and  no longer able to sleep  stood by 
his window and looked out into the darkness by day he could see 
from his balcony at bikavac the whole river valley and all the con  
struction works  with the barracks  mills  stables and all that deva  
stated and littered space around them  now in the darkness he sensed 
their presence and thought with bitterness how slowly the work was 
proceeding and how  sooner or later  this must reach the vezir s ears  
someone would be sure to see to that if no one else  then that 
smooth  cold and crafty tosun effendi then it might chance that he 
might fall into disgrace with the vezir that was what prevented 
him from sleeping  and even when he did fall asleep he trembled in 
his dreams  his food seemed poison to him  men seemed odious and 
his life dark when he even thought of it disgrace  that meant that 
he would be exiled from the vezir s presence  that his enemies would 
laugh at him  ah  anything but that    that he would be nothing 
and nobody  no more than a rag  a good for nothing  not only m the 
eyes of others but also m his own it would mean giving up his hard 
won fortune or  if he managed to keep it  to eke it out stealthily  
far from stambul  somewhere in the obscure provinces  forgotten  
superfluous  ridiculous  wretched  no  anything but that  better not 
to see the sun  not to breathe the air  it would be a hundred times 
better to be nobody and to have nothing  that was the thought that 
always came back to him and several times a day forced the blood 
to beat painfully in his skull and his temples  but even at other 
times never completely left him but lay like a black cloud within 
him  that was what disgrace meant to him  and disgrace was possible 
every day  every hour  since everyone was working to bring it on 
him  only he alone worked against it and defended himself  it was 
one man against everyone and everything that had now lasted fif  
teen years  from the first time that the vezir had entrusted him with 


   



a great and important task  who could endure it  who could sleep 
and be at peace  

although it was a cold damp autumn night  abidaga opened the 
casement and looked into the darkness  for the closed room seemed 
stifling to him then he noticed that there were lights and move  
ments on the scaffolding and along the banks when he saw that 
there were more and more of them  he thought that something 
unusual must have happened  dressed and woke his servant  thus 
he arrived at the lighted stable just at the moment when the man 
from plevlje no longer knew what further insults to use  whom to 
order and what to do to shorten the time 

the unexpected arrival of abidaga completely bewildered him  
so much had he longed for this moment  yet now that it had come 
he did not know how to profit from it as he had hoped he stuttered 
in excitement and forgot all about the bound peasant  abidaga 
only gazed through him disdainfully and went straight up to the 
prisoner  

in the stable they had built up a big fire to which the guards kept 
adding fresh faggots so that even the most distant corner was lit up  

abidaga stood looking down at the bound peasant for he was 
much the taller man he was calm and thoughtful everyone waited 
for him to speak  while he thought to himself  so this is the one with 
whom i have had to struggle and fight  this is what my position and 
my fate depended upon  this wretched half witted renegade from 
plevlje and the incomprehensible and obdurate opposition of this 
louse from the rayah  then he shook himself and began to give 
orders and to question the peasant  

the stable filled with guards  and outside could be heard the 
voices of the awakened overseers and workmen abidaga put his 
questions through the man from plevlje 

radisav first said that he and another man had decided to run 
away and that therefore they had prepared a small raft and set off 
downstream  when they pointed out to him the senselessness of 
this story since it was impossible in the darkness to go down 
the turbulent river full of whirlpools  rocks and shoals  and that 
those who want to run away do not climb on the scaffolding and 
damage the works  he fell silent and only muttered sullenly  

 well  i am in your hands do what you like   

 you will soon find out what we like   abidaga retorted briskly  

the guards took away the chains and stripped the peasant to 
the buff they threw the chains into the heart of the fire and waited  
as the chains were covered with soot  their hands were blackened 
and great patches were left on themselves and on the half naked 


   



peasant  when the chains were almost red hot  merdjan the gipsy 
came up and took one end of them in a long pair of tongs  while one 
of the guards took the other end  

the man from plevlje translated abidaga s words  

 perhaps now you will tell the whole truth   

 what have i got to tell you  you know everything and can do 
what you like   

the two men brought the chains and wrapped them round the 
the peasant s broad hairy chest  the scorched hair began to sizzle 
his mouth contracted  the veins in his neck swelled  his ribs seemed 
to stand out and his stomach muscles to contract and relax as 
when a man vomits he groaned from the pain  strained at the ropes 
which bound him and writhed and twisted in vain to lessen the 
contact of his body with the red hot iron  his eyes closed and the 
tears flowed down his cheeks they took the chain away 

that was only a beginning  isn t it better to talk without that   

the peasant only breathed heavily through his nose  and remained 
silent  

 who was with you   

 his name was jovan  but i do not know either his house or his 
village   

they brought the chains again and the burning hair and skin 
sizzled coughing from the smoke and writhing from the pain  the 
peasant began to speak jerkily 

those two alone had come to an agreement to destroy the work 
on the bridge they thought that it had to be done and they had 
done it  no one else had known anything about it or had taken 
part in it  at first they had set out from the banks in various places 
and been quite successful  but when they saw that there were guards 
on the scaffolding and along the banks  they had thought of binding 
three planks together to make a raft and thus  unnoticed  approach 
the work from the river  that had been three days ago on the first 
night they had nearly been caught they only  ust got away  so 
the next night they had not gone out at all when they tried again 
that same night with the raft  there had happened what had 
happened  

 that is all  so it was  and so we worked  now do what you will   

 no  no  that is not what we want  tell us who made you do this  
what you have suffered up till now is nothing to what you will 
get later on   

 well  do what you like   

merdjan then came nearer with a pair of pincers  he knelt in 
front of the bound man and began to tear the nails off his naked feet  


   



the peasant remained silent and clenched his teeth but a strange 
trembling shook his whole body up to the waist even though he was 
bound which showed that the pain must have been exceptionally 
great after a few moments the peasant forced a few muttered words 
through his teeth the man from plevlje  who had been hanging 
on his every word and waiting eagerly for some sort of admission  
made a sign with his hand to the gipsy to stop and at once asked  

 what was that  what did you say   

 nothing i only said  why in the name of god do you waste your 
time torturing me   

 tell us who made you do it   

 who made me do it  why  the devil   

 the devil   

 the devil certainly that same devil who made you come here 
and build the bridge   

the peasant spoke softly  but clearly and decisively  

the devil  a strange word  said so bitterly in so unusual a situ  
ation  the devil  the devil is certainly somewhere in this thought 
the man from plevlje  standing with bowed head as if the bound 
man were questioning him and not he the bound man  the words 
touched him on a sensitive spot and awoke in him all of a sudden 
all his anxieties and fears  in all their strength and terror  as if they 
had never been swept away by the capture of the culprit  perhaps 
indeed all this  with abidaga and the building of the bridge and 
this mad peasant  was the devil s work  the devil  perhaps he was 
the only one to fear the man from plevlje shivered and shook him  
self at that moment the loud and angry voice of abidaga brought 
him to himself  

 what s the matter with you  are you asleep  good for nothing   
shouted abidaga  striking his right boot with his short leather 
whip 

the gipsy was still kneeling with the pincers in his hand and 
looking upwards with black shining eyes  frightened and humble  
at the tall figure of abidaga  the guards piled up the fire which 
was already roaring the whole place shone  it was like a furnace 
but somehow solemn  what that evening had seemed a gloomy and 
undistinguished building all at once was transformed  became larger  
widened out  in the stable and around it reigned a sort of solemn 
emotion and a special silence as there is in places where one extracts 
the truth  a living man is tortured or where fateful things occur  
abidaga  the man from plevlje and the bound man moved and spoke 
like actors and all the others went on tiptoe with lowered eyes  not 
speaking save when forced to and then only in a whisper  everyone 


   



wished to be somewhere else  only not to be in this place nor at 
this work  but since that was not possible  they all lowered their 
voices and moved as little as they could  as if to get as far away as 
possible from this affair  

seeing that the interrogation was going slowly and did not give 
any hope of results  abidaga with impatient movements and loud 
oaths went out of the stable  after him reeled the man from plevlje  
followed by the guards 

outside it was growing light  the sun had not yet risen  but the 
whole horizon was clear  deep among the hills the clouds lay in 
long dull purple bands and between them could be seen the clear 
sky almost green in colour scattered patches of mist lay over the 
moist earth out of which peeked the tops of the fruit trees with 
sparse yellowish leaves still striking at his boot with his whip  
abidaga gave orders  the criminal should continue to be interro  
gated  especially about those who had helped him  but he should 
not be tortured beyond endurance lest he die  everything must be 
made ready so that at noon that same day he should be impaled alive 
on the outermost part of the construction work at its highest point  
so that the whole town and all the workers should be able to see 
him from the banks of the river  merdjan was to get everything 
ready and the town crier to announce the execution through all 
the quarters of the town  so that at midday all the people might see 
what happened to those who hindered the building of the bridge  
and that the whole male population  both turks and rayah  from 
children to old men  must gather on one or other of the banks to 
witness it  

the day which was dawning was a sunday on sunday work 
went on as on any other day  but this day even the overseers were 
distrait  as soon as it was broad daylight  the news spread about 
the capture of the criminal  his torture and his execution which was 
to take place at midday the hushed and solemn mood of the stable 
spread over the whole area about the building works  the men on 
forced labour worked silently  each one avoided looking his neigh  
bour in the eyes  and each man looked only to the work before 
him as if that were the beginning and the end of his world 

an hour before noon the people of the town  for the most part 
turks  had collected on a level space near the bridge children were 
hoisted on to high blocks of building stone which were lying about  
the workmen swarmed around the narrow benches where the 
meagre rations which kept them alive were usually distributed  
chewing at them  they were silent and looked uneasily about them  
a little later abidaga appeared  accompanied by tosun fffpindi  

   



mastro antonio and one or two of the more prominent turks  
all stood on a small dry hummock between the bridge and the stable 
where the condemned man was  abidaga went once more to the 
stable  where he was told that everything was ready  lying there 
was an oak stake about eight feet long  pointed as was necessary 
and tipped with iron  quite thin and sharp  and all well greased 
with lard on the scaffolding were the blocks between which the 
stake w ould be embedded and nailed  a wooden mallet for the 
impalement  ropes and everything else that was needed  

the man from plevlje was distraught  his face earthen in colour 
and hjs eyes bloodshot even now he was not able to endure 
abidaga s flaming glances 

 listen  you  if everything is not as it should be and if you disgrace 
me m public  neither you nor your bastard of a gipsy will ever 
appeal before me again  for i will drown you both in the drina like 
a pair of blind puppies   

then  turning to the shivering gipsy  he said more kindly  

 you will get six grosh for the job  and another six if he stays 
alive till nightfall see to it   

the hod a called out from the main mosque in the market place 
in a clear sharp voice  uneasiness spread among the assembled 
people and a few  moments later the door of the stable opened ten 
guards were drawn up in two ranks  five on either side  between 
them was radislav  barefooted and bareheaded  alert and stooping 
as ever  but he no longer  sowed  as he walked but marched strangely 
with short steps  almost skipping on his mutilated feet with bleeding 
holes where the nails had been  on his shoulders he carried a long 
white sharpened stake behind him was merdjan with two other 
gipsies who were to be his helpers in the execution of the sentence  
suddenly from somewhere or other the man from plevlje appeared 
on his bay and took his place at the head of the procession  which 
only had to go about a hundred paces to reach the first scaffolding  

the people craned their necks and stood on tiptoe to see the man 
who had hatched the plot and destroyed the building work  they 
were all astonished at the poor miserable appearance of the man 
they had imagined to be quite different naturally  none of them 
knew  why he hopped in so droll a manner and took abrupt little 
steps  and none of them could see the burns from the chains which 
crossed his chest like great belts  for his shirt and cloak hid them  
therefore he seemed to all those there too wretched and too insigni  
ficant to have done the deed which now brought him to execution  
only the long white stake gave a sort of gruesome grandeur to the 
scene and kept everyone s eyes fixed on it  


   



when they reached the spot on the bank where the excavation 
work began  the man from plevlje dismounted and with a sort of 
solemn and theatrical air gave the reins to a groom  then disappeared 
with the others in the steep muddy track w hich led down to the 
water s edge a little later the people saw them again as they 
appeared in the same order on the staging  climbing upwards slowly 
and carefully on the narrow passages made of planks and beams 
the guards closely surrounded radisav and kept him very near them 
lest he should leap into the river they dragged their way along 
slowly and climbed even higher till they reached the top there  
high above the water  was a boarded space about the size of a small 
room on it  as on a raised stage  they took their places  radisav  
the man from plevlje and the three gipsies  with the rest of the 
guards posted around them on the staging 
the people watchmg moved uneasily and shifted about  only 
a hundred paces separated them from those planks  so that they 
could see every man and every movement  but could not hear words 
or distinguish details  the people and the workmen on the left bank 
were about three times farther away  and moved around as much 
as they could and made every effort to try to see and hear better  
but they could hear nothing and what they could see seemed 
at first only too ordinary and uninteresting and at the end so terrible 
that they turned their heads away and many quickly went home  
regretting that they had ever come  

when they ordered radisav to he down  he hesitated a moment 
and then  looking past the gipsies and guards as if they were not 
there  came close up to the man from plevlje and said almost con  
fidentially as if speaking to a friend  softly and heavily  

 listen  by this world and the next  do your best to pierce me well 
so that i may not suffer like a dog   

the man from plevlje started and shouted at him  as if defending 
himself from that too intimate approach  

 march  vlachl you who are so great a hero as to destroy the 
sultan s work now beg for mercy like a woman  it will be as it has 
been ordered and as you have deserved   

radisav bent his head still lower and the gipsies came up and 
began to strip off his cloak and his shirt  on his chest the wounds 
from the chains stood out  red and swollen  without another word 
the peasant lay down as he had been ordered  face downward  the 
gipsies approached and the first bound his hands behind his back  
then they attached a cord to each of his legs  around the ankles  
then they pulled outwards and to the side  stretching his legs wide 
apart  meanwhile merdjan placed the stake on two small wooden 

   



chocks so that it pointed between the peasant s legs then he took 
from his belt a short broad knife  knelt beside the stretched out man 
and leant over him to cut away the cloth of his trousers and to 
widen the opening through which the stake would enter his body  
this most terrible part of the bloody task was  luckily  invisible to 
the onlookers they could only see the bound body shudder at the 
short and unexpected prick of the knife  then half rise as if it were 
going to stand up  only to fall back again at once  striking dully 
against the planks as soon as he had finished  the gipsy leapt up  
took the wooden mallet and with slow measured blows began to 
strike the lower blunt end of the stake between each two blows he 
would stop for a moment and look first at the body in which the 
stake was penetrating and then at the two gipsies  reminding them 
to pull slowly and evenly  the body of the peasant  spreadeagled  
writhed convulsively  at each blow of the mallet his spine 
twisted and bent  but the cords pulled at it and kept it straight the 
silence from both banks of the river was such that not only every 
blow but even its echo from somewhere along the steep bank could 
be clearly heard  those nearest could hear how the man beat with 
his forehead against the planks and  even more  another and unusual 
sound  that was neither a scream  nor a wail  nor a groan  nor any  
thing human  that stretched and twisted body emitted a sort of 
creaking and cracking like a fence that is breaking down or a tree 
that is being felled at every second blow the gipsy went over to 
the stretched out body and leant over it to see whether the stake was 
going m the right direction and when he had satisfied himself that 
it had not touched any of the more important internal organs  he 
returned and went on with his work  

from the banks all this could scarcely be heard and still less seen  
but all stood there trembling  their faces blanched and their fingers 
chilled with cold 

for a moment the hammering ceased  merdjan now saw that close 
to the right shoulder muscles the skin was stretched and swollen  he 
went forward quickly and cut the swollen place with two crossed 
cuts  pale blood flowed out  at first slowly then faster and faster  two 
or three more blows  light and careful  and the iron shod point of the 
stake began to break through at the place where he had cut he 
struck a few more times until the point of the stake reached level 
with the right ear  the man was impaled on the stake as a lamb on 
the spit  only that the tip did not come through the mouth but in the 
back and had not seriously damaged the intestines  the heart or the 
lungs  then merdjan threw down the mallet and came nearer  he 
looked at the unmovmg body  avoiding the blood which poured out 


   



of the places where the stake had enteied and had come out again 
and was gathering in little pools on the planks the two gipsies 
turned the stiffened body on its back and began to bind the legs to 
the foot of the stake meanwhile merdjan looked to see if the man 
were still alive and carefully examined the face that had suddenly 
become swollen  wider and larger the ejes were wide open and 
restless  but the eyelids were unmoving  the mouth was wide open 
but the two lips stiff and contracted and between them the clenched 
teeth shone white since the man could no longer control some of 
his facial muscles the face looked like a mask but the heart beat 
heavily and the lungs worked with short  quickened breath the two 
gipsies began to lift him up like a sheep on a spit merdjan shouted 
to them to take care and not shake the body  he himself went to help 
them  then they embedded the lower  thicker end of the stake 
between two beams and fixed it there with huge nails and then 
behind  at the same height  buttressed the whole thing with a 
short strut which was nailed both to the stake and to a beam on the 
staging  

when that too had been done  the gipsies climbed down and 
joined the guards  and on that open space  raised a full eight feet up  
right  stiff and bare to the waist  the man on the stake remained alone  
from a distance it could only be guessed that the stake to which his 
legs had been bound at the ankles passed right through his body so 
that the people saw him as a statue  high up in the air on the very 
edge of the staging  high above the river  

a murmur and a wave of movement passed through the onlookers 
on the banks  some lowered their eyes and others went quickly 
home without turning their heads but the majority looked dumbly 
at this human likeness  up there in space  unnaturally stiff and up  
right  fear chilled their entrails and their legs threatened to give way 
beneath them  but they were still unable to move away or take their 
eyes from the sight  and amid that terrified crowd mad ilinka 
threaded her way  looking everyone in the eyes and trying to read 
their glances to find from them where her sacrificed and buried 
children were  

then the man from plevlje  merdjan and a pair of guards went up 
to the impaled man and began to examine him more closely only a 
thin trickle of blood flowed down the stake  he was alive and con  
scious  his ribs rose and fell  the veins in his neck pulsed and his 
eyes kept turning slowly but unceasingly through the clenched 
teeth came a long drawn out groaning in which a few words could 
with difficulty be distinguished 

turks  turks         moaned the man on the stake   turks on the 



bridge     may you die like dogs       like dogs   

the gipsies picked up their tools and then  with the man from 
plevlje  came down from the staging to the bank  the people made 
way for them and began to disperse only the children on the high 
blocks of stone and the bare trees waited a little longer  not knowing 
if this weie the end or whether there would be more  to see what 
would happen next with that strange man who hovered over the 
waters as if suddenly frozen in the midst of a leap  

the man from plevlje approached abidaga and reported that 
everything had been carried out correctly and satisfactorily  that the 
cnminal was still alive and that it seemed that he would go on living 
since his internal organs had not been damaged  abidaga did not 
reply but only gave a sign with his hand to bring his horse and began 
to say goodbye to tosun effendi and mastro antonio  everyone be  
gan to disperse  through the market place the town cner could be 
heard announcing that the sentence had been carried out and that 
the same or a worse punishment awaited anyone who would do the 
like in future  

the man from plevlje remained in perplexity on the level space 
which had now suddenly emptied his servant held his horse and the 
guards waited for orders  he felt that he ought to say something but 
was not able to because of the wave of feeling that only now began 
to rise within him and choke him only now did he become conscious 
of all that he had forgotten since he had been too busy carrying out 
the sentence  he remembered abidaga s threat that it would have 
been he who would have been placed upon the stake had he not suc  
ceeded in catching the criminal  he had escaped that horror  but only 
by a hair and only at the last moment  but things had turned out 
otherwise the sight of that man  who was hanging  bound and still 
alive  over the river filled him with terror and also with a sort of 
painful joy that such a fate had not been his and that his body was 
still undamaged  was free and able to move  at that thought burning 
pains shot through his chest and spread into his legs and arms and 
forced him to move about  to smile and to speak  just to prove to 
himself that he was healthy  that he could move freely  could speak 
and laugh aloud  could even sing if he so wished  and not merely 
mutter useless curses from a stake  awaiting death as the only happi  
ness which could still be his  his hands and arms moved of their own 
volition  his lips opened and from them flowed unwittingly a 
strangled laugh and a copious flow of words  

 ha  ha  ha  radisav  thou mountain vtla  why so stiff        why not 
go on and undermine the bridge        why writhe and groan  sing  
vifa  dance  vilav 


   



astonished and bewildered  the guards w atched their leader dance 
with outstretched arms  heard him sing and choice with laughter and 
with strange words  saw the white foam oozing more and more from 
the corners of his lips and his bay horse  in fear  cast sidelong 
glances at him 


   



iv 




m    those who had been present at the execution of the sentence 

   spread terrible reports through the town and the surround  
mg villages an indescribable fear gripped the townsmen and 
the workers  slowly and gradually a full consciousness of 
what had happened in their midst in the course of a short november 
day came home to them  all conversation centred on the man who  
high up there on the scaffolding  was still alive on the stake every  
one resolved not to speak of him  but what good was that when 
their thoughts turned continually to him and all glances centred on 
the spot  

the peasants coming from banja carting stone in their bullock 
carts turned their eyes away and curtly ordered their oxen to make 
haste the workers at work along the banks and on the staging called 
to one another in hushed voices and as little as they could the over  
seers themselves  with their wooden staves in their hands  were sub  
dued and less brutal the dalmatian stonemasons clenched their 
jaws  turned their backs on the bridge and struck angrily with their 
chisels which in the universal stillness sounded like a flock of wood  
peckers  

twilight came quickly and the workers hurried to their hovels in 
the wish to get as far as possible from the staging before it was quite 
dark  merdjan and a trusted servant of abidaga once more climbed 
the staging and definitely confirmed that radisav was even then  
four hours after the sentence had been carried out  alive and con  
scious consumed with fever  he rolled his eyes slowly and painfully  
and when he saw the gipsy below him  he began to groan more 
loudly in this groaning  which showed his life was ebbing  it was 
possible to distinguish only a few isolated words  

 the turks     the turks   the bridge   

having satisfied themselves  they returned to abidaga s house at 
bikavac  telling everyone whom they met on their way that the 
criminal was still alive  and since he ground his teeth and spoke well 
and clearly from the stake there was every hope that he would live 


   



until noon the next day abidaga too was satisfied and gave orders 
that merdjan was to be paid his promised reward 
that night everything living m the town and about the bridge 
slept in fear or rather those who could slept but there were many 
to whom sleep would not come  

the next day which was a monday dawned a sunny november 
morning there was not an eye in the whole town or about the build  
ing work that did not turn towards that intricate criss cross of beams 
and planks over the waters  at the farther end of which  upright and 
apart  was the man on the stake many who  on waking  had thought 
that they had dreamt all that had taken place the day before upon 
the bridge  now rose and with fixed eyes looked at the continuance 
of this nightmare which remained there stark in the sun 
amongst the workers there was still that hush of the day before  
filled with pity and bitterness in the towm there w as still that whis  
pering and anxiety merdjan and that same servant of abidaga s 
climbed up the scaffolding once more and examined the condemned 
man  they spoke to each other  lifted their eyes and looked upwards 
into the face of the peasant and then  suddenly  merdjan pulled at 
his trousers from the way in which they made their way down  
wards to the bank and walked silently through the men at work  
everyone realized that the peasant had at last died those who were 
serbs felt a certain easing of the spirit  as at an invisible victory  

now they looked more boldly up at the scaffolding and the man 
who had been condemned they felt as if fate  m their continual 
wrestling and measuring of forces with the turks  had now inclined 
to their side  death was the greatest trump in the game  mouths till 
then contracted in fear now began to open muddy  wet  unshaven 
and pale  rolling great blocks of banja stone with pinewood levers  
they halted for a moment to spit on their palms and say to each other 
in hushed voices  

 may god pardon him and have mercy upon him   

 ah  the martyr  it is hard for such as we   

 don t you see that he has become a saint   

and everyone glanced up at the dead man who stayed there as up  
right as if he had been marching at the head of a company  up there  
so high  he no longer seemed terrible or pitiful to them  on the other 
hand  it was now clear to all of them how he was exalted and set 
apart  he no longer stood on the earth  his hands held to nothing  he 
did not swim  did not fly  he no longer had any weight freed from 
all earthly ties and burdens  he was no longer a prey to troubles  no 
one could do anything more against him  neither rifle nor sword  nor 
evil thoughts  nor men s words  nor turkish courts  naked to the 


   



waist  with arms and legs bound  his head thrown back against the 
stake  that figure no longer seemed to bear any likeness to a h uman 
body which grows and then rots away  but seemed to be raised on 
high  hard and imper   l    lc rs   statue which would remain there 
forever  

the men on foiled  abcur turned and crossed themselves 
stealthily  

in mejdan the women hurried through the courtyards to whisper 
to each other for a moment or so and weep  and then at once rushed 
back to see if the luncheon had burnt  one of them lighted an ikon  
lamp quickly  in all the houses  ikon lamps hidden away in the 
corners of the rooms began to glow the children  blinking in this 
solemn atmosphere  looked at the brightness and listened to the 
broken and incomprehensible sentences of their elders   defend us    
lord  and protect us     ah  martyr  he is chosen before god as if he 
had built the greatest of churches     help us    lord  thou holy 
one  drive away the enemy and do not let him rule longer over us    
and incessantly asked who was the martyr and who was building a 
church and where  the small boys were especially inquisitive  their 
mothers hushed them  

 be quiet  my soul  be quiet and listen to mother  as long as you 
are alive keep away from those accursed turks   

before it began to darken  abidaga once more went around the 
construction work and  satisfied with the result of this terrible 
example  ordered that the peasant be taken down from the stake  

 throw the dog to the dogs   

that night  which fell suddenly as soft and moist as spring  there 
began an incomprehensible murmuring  a coming and going among 
the workers  even those who had not wanted to hear of destruction 
and resistance were now ready to make sacrifices and do all that 
they could the man on the stake had become an object of general 
attention as if he had been holy  some hundreds of exhausted men  
moved by an inner force made up of pity and ancient custom  in  
stinctively joined in an effort to get the corpse of the martyred man  
to prevent it from being profaned and to give it christian burial  
after cautious whispered consultations in the huts and stables  the 
men on forced labour collected among themselves the considerable 
sum of seven grosh with which to bribe merdjan  to carry out this 
work they chose three of the craftiest among them and succeeded in 
getting in touch with the executioner wet and tired from their 
labours  the three peasants bargained  slowly and cunningly  going 
round and round the point  frowning  scratching his head and stut  
tering intentionally  the oldest of the peasants said to the gipsy  


ss 



well it s all over now it was so fated still  you know  it is  a 
human being  one of god s creations it shouldn t you know 
what i mean   it shouldn t be eaten by beasts or torn to bits by 
dogs  

merdjan  who knew well enough what was in the wind  defended 
himself  more sorrowfully than obstinately 
 no don t even speak of it you ll get me well roasted you don t 
know what a ivnx that abidaga is   

the peasant was troubled  frowned and thought to himself   he is 
a gipsy  a thing without cross or soul  one cannot call him either 
friend or brother  and one cannot take his word by anything in 
heaven or earth   and held his hand in the shallow pocket of his 
cloak tightly grasping the seven grosh  

 i know that very well we all know that it is not easy for you 
only  no one can blame you here we have got together four grosh 
for you which  as we see it  should be enough      

 no  no  my life is dearer to me than all the treasure in the world  
abidaga would never let me live  that one sees everything  even 
when he is asleep  i am dead at the mere thought of it   

 four grosh  even five  but that s all we can do  we could even find 
that much   went on the peasant  paying no heed to the gipsy s 
laments  

 i dare not  i dare not     

 very well then since you have got your orders to throw 
the the body to the to the dogs  you will throw it  but what 
happens after that is none of your affair  nor wnll anyone ask you 
about it so you see if we  for example  should take that that 
body and should bury it somewhere according to our law but  let 
us say  stealthily so that not a living soul will know       then you 
will  for example  say next day that the dogs have       have carried 
away that   that body no one will be any the worse and you will 
have got your share   

the peasant spoke carefully and with circumspection  only he 

halted with a strange uneasiness before the word  body  

 am i to lose my head for five grosh  no  no  n o o    

 for six   added the peasant calmly  

the gipsy drew himself up  spread out his arms  and assumed an 
expression of moving sincerity  as only men who do not distinguish 
truth from lies can do he stood before the peasant as though he were 
the judge and the peasant the criminal  

 let it be on my head  since that is my fate  and let my chai remain 
a widow and my children beggars  if you give me seven grosh  take 
the body away  but no one must see and no one must know   

   



the peasant shook his head  regretting deeply that this scab must 
get everything right down to the last farthing  as if the gipsy had 
been able to see into his closed fist  

then they came to an agreement  down to the last detail merdjan 
was to bring the corpse  when he had taken it from the scaffolding  
to the left bank of the river and there  as soon as it grew dark  was 
to throw it down on a stony patch near the road  so that it could be 
seen both by abidaga s servants and by anyone who might be pass  
ing by the three peasants would be hidden in a thicket  a little far  
ther on as soon as darkness fell  they would take the corpse  carry 
it away and bury it  but m a hidden place and without any visible 
trace  so that it would seem quite likely that the dogs had dragged it 
away overnight and eaten it three grosh were to be paid m advance 
and four more when the job was finished  

that same night everything was carried out according to the 
agreement  

at twilight merdjan brought the corpse and threw it on the road  
side   it no longer resembled that body which all had looked at for 
the past two days  upright and stiff upon the stake  this was once 
again the old radisav  small and bowed  only now without blood or 
life   then he went back at once with his assistants by the ferry to 
the town on the other bank  the peasants waited in the thicket  one 
or two late workers passed  and a turk on his way home to the town  
then the whole countryside became quite still and dark dogs began 
to appear  those powerful  mangy  hungry cowardly curs without 
masters or homes  the peasants concealed in the undergrowth threw 
stones at them and drove them away  they ran with tails between 
their legs but only for twelve paces or so from the corpse where they 
waited to see what would happen next  their eyes could be seen 
glowing and shining  when it was clear that night had really fallen 
and there was no longer any likelihood that anyone else would come 
along  the peasants came out of their hiding place carrying a pick 
and shovel  they had also brought two planks with them on which 
they placed the corpse and so carried it away  there in a gully caused 
by the spring and autumn rains rushing down the hill into the drina  
they removed the larger stones which formed the bed of a dry water  
course  and dug out a deep grave quickly  silently  without words 
and without noise in it they placed the cold  stiff  twisted body  the 
oldest of the peasants leapt into the pit  crossed himself carefully a 
few times  lit first a piece of tinder and then a small candle of twisted 
wax  shielding the light with his two hands  he placed it above the 
head of the dead man and crossed himself  repeating three times 
quickly and aloud  tn the name of the father  the son and the holy 


   



spirit   the two men with him crossed themselves m the darkness 
above  the peasant then made a movement with his hands over the 
dead man as if pouring from his empty hand the unseen wine and 
said twice  softly and reverently 

 peace with the saints  o christ  for the soul of thy slave   

then he whispered a few more words  disconnected and incom  
prehensible  but sounding like prayers  solemn and reverent  while 
the two men above the grave crossed themselves continually when 
he had ended  they lowered the two planks so that they formed a 
sort of roof over the dead man then the peasant crossed himself 
once more  extinguished the candle and climbed out of the grave 
then  slowly and carefully  they replaced the earth in the grave  
treading it down well so that no sw elling could be seen when that 
was done  they put back the stones  like the bed of the stream  across 
the freshly dug earth  crossed themselves once more and went back 
home  making a wide detour so as to rejoin the road at a point as far 
away as possible  

that night there fell a dense soft ram without wind  and in the 
morning that dawned the whole river valley was filled with milky 
mist and a heavy moisture in a sort of white resplendence which 
now rose and now fell  the sun could be seen somewhere struggling 
with the mists which it was unable to pierce all was ghostly  new 
and strange  men suddenly appeared out of the mist and equally sud  
denly were lost in it in such weather  early in the morning  there 
passed through the market place a simple country cart and on it two 
guards watching the man from plevlje  their leader until the day 
before  bound and under arrest  

from the previous day  when in the access of unexpected emotion 
at finding himself still alive and not on the stake he had begun to 
dance before them all  he had never calmed down  all his muscles 
twitched  he could no longer keep still  but was constantly tor  
mented by the irresistible urge to prove to himself and show others 
that he was still healthy  whole and capable of movement at inter  
vals he would remember abidaga  that was the black spot in his new 
 oy   and would fall into a dark reverie  but while he was in this 
mood  fresh forces would collect within him which drove him irre  
sistibly to wild and spasmodic movements like a madman  he would 
get up again and begin to dance  spreading out his arms  clicking his 
fingers and twisting like a dancer  showing by sudden and lively 
actions that he was not on the stake and gasping to the rhythm of 
his dance  

 see     see     i can do this     and that       and that         

he refused to eat and would suddenly break off every conversa  

   



tion that he began and start to dance  affirming childishly at every 
movement  

 see  see  i can do this       and this          

when that night they finally decided to tell abidaga what had 
happened  he replied coldly and abruptly  

take the madman to plevlje and let them keep him chained up 
m his own house there  so that he does not play the fool round here  
he was not the man for a job like that   

so was it done  but as their leader was unable to keep still  his 
guards were forced to bind him to the cart in which he was sitting  
he wept and defended himself and as long as he was able to move 
any part of his body  he struggled and shouted   see  seel  finally 
they had to bind his arms and his legs  so that now he sat in the cart 
upright like a sack of wheat swaddled in ropes but  since he was no 
longer able to move  he began to imagine that they were impaling 
him on the stake and writhed and resisted with desperate cries  

 not me  not me  catch the vila  no  abidagal  

from the last houses on the outskirts of the town  people rushed 
out excited by his cries  but the cart with the guards and the sick 
man was swiftly lost to sight in the thick mist along the dobruna 
road through which the sun could just be glimpsed  

the unexpected and pitiable departure of the man from plevlje 
instilled still greater fear into men s bones  it began to be whispered 
that the condemned peasant had been innocent and that this had 
preyed on the mind of the man from plevlje  among the serbs in 
mejdan the women began to tell how the vilas had buried the dead 
body of the hapless radisav below butkovo stijene and how at night 
a plenteous light fell upon his grave  thousands and thousands of 
lighted candles which flamed and quivered in a long line reaching 
from heaven to earth  they had seen them through their tears  

all sorts of things were whispered and believed  but fear was 
stronger than all else  

work on the bridge was carried on quickly  smoothly and without 
interruption or hindrance  it went on somehow or other until the 
beginning of december when an unexpectedly hard frost came  
against which even abidaga s power could do nothing  

there were unheard of frosts and blizzards in that first half of 
december  the stones froze into the ground and the wood cracked 
a fine crystalline snow covered everything  tools and whole huts  
and the next day a capricious wind would drive it to another side 
and bury another part  work ceased of itself and the fear of 
abidaga paled and finally disappeared abidaga tried to fight against 
it for some days but finally gave way  he dismissed the workers and 


   



stopped the work in the midst of the heaviest snow fall he rode away 
with his men  that same day tosun effendi set out on a peasant s 
sleigh heaped with straw and blankets  and after him mastro 
antonio  in the opposite direction and all that camp of forced 
labourers dispersed into the villages and the deep valleys without a 
sound and as imperceptibly as water soaked up by the earth the 
building works remained like a discarded toy 

before setting out abidaga again summoned the leading turks 
he was depressed by his angry impotence and told them  as in the 
previous year  that he left everything in their hands and that theirs 
was the responsibility  

 i am going away but my eyes remain here take heed  better that 
you cut off a score of disobedient heads than that a single nail of the 
sultan s should be lost  as soon as spring breaks   shall be here once 
more and shall call everyone to account   

the leaders promised everything as they had the year before and 
dispersed to their homes  filled with anxiety and wrapped in their 
cloaks  capes and shawls  thanking god to themselves that god had 
given winter blizzards to the world and had in that way shown that 
his power was able to put a limit to the power of the mighty 

but when spring broke again  it was not abidaga who came  but a 
new representative of the vezir  arif beg  together with tosun 
effendi what he had so much feared had happened to abidaga 
someone  someone whom he knew well and had worked near him  
had sent to the grand vezir detailed and accurate reports of his 
work on the visegrad bridge the vezir had been accurately in  
formed that for those two years between two and three hundred 
workmen had been summoned for forced labour every day without 
a single para of pay and very often bnnging their own food  and that 
abidaga had taken the vezir s money for himself  the amount of 
money that he had up till then managed to embezzle was also 
reckoned  he had covered up his dishonesty  as is so often the case 
in life  by excessive zeal and exaggerated severity  so that the people 
of the whole distnct  not only the rayah but also the turks  instead 
of giving thanks for this great bequest  cursed both the hour when 
it had been begun and the man for whom it was being built  mehmed 
pasha  who had been struggling all his life with the peculations and 
dishonesty of his officials  had ordered his unworthy servant to re  
imburse the whole sum and take what remained of his fortune and 
his harem and go at once to a small town in anatolia  and never to 
let himself be heard of again unless he wanted a worse fate to befall 
him  

two days after arif beg  mastro antonio also arrived from 

 o 



dalmatia with the first workers  tosun effendi presented him to the 
new chief  and on a warm sunny april day they inspected the con  
struction works and settled the order for the first work  after arif 
beg had withdrawn  leaving the other two alone on the bank  
mastro antonio looked attentively at the face of tosun effendi 
who  even on so sunny a day  was huddled up in a wide black 
mantle  

this is quite another sort of man  thanks be to god  i only ask 
myself who was so smart and so brave as to inform the vezir and 
have that animal removed   

tosun effendi only looked straight in front of him and said 
quietly  

there is no doubt  this one is better   

tt must have been someone who knew abidaga s affairs well and 
who had access to the vezir and enjoyed his trust   

 certainly  certainly  this one is better   replied tosun effendi 
without looking up and wrapping his mantle even more closely 
around him  

so the work began under the new chief  arif beg  

he was  indeed  quite a different sort of man  exceptionally tall  
stooping  bald  with salient cheekbones and slit like black laughing 
eyes  the people at once nicknamed him misir baba old baldie  
without shouting  without a staff  without big words or visible 
effort  he gave orders and set everything in order good humouredly 
and casually with confident authority  he never overlooked any  
thing or lost track of anything but he also brought with him a feel  
ing of strict attention to everything that was the vezir s will or 
order  but like a calm  normal and honest man who had nothing to 
be afraid of and nothing to conceal  so that he had no need to 
frighten or persecute anyone the work went on at the same speed 
 since speed was what the vezir wanted   faults were punished with 
similar severity  but unpaid forced labour was stopped from that 
day  all the workers were paid and received rations in flour and salt  
and all went quicker and better than in abidaga s time  also  mad 
ilinka vanished  during the winter she had disappeared somewhere 
into the villages  

the construction work grew and extended  

it could now be seen that the vezir s bequest was not for a bridge 
only  but also for a han or caravanserai  in which travellers from 
afar who intended to cross the bridge could find shelter for them  
selves  their horses and their goods should they arrive at nightfall  
on arif beg s order the construction of this caravanserai was com  
menced  at the entry to the market place      paces from the 

   



bridge  just where the road to mejdan began to rise steeply  there 
was a level space on which until then the wednesday stock market 
had been held  on this level space the building of the new han began  
work went on slowly  but from the very start it could be seen that 
it would be a solid and grandiose building conceived on a grand 
scale  the people scarcely even noticed how  slowly but surely  a 
great stone han was rising  for their attention was wholly centred on 
the building of the bridge  

what was now being done on the drina was so complicated  all 
the work so interlocked and complex  that the loungers in the town  
who watched the building work from the two banks as if it were 
some natural phenomenon  could no longer follow it with under  
standing  there were always fresh embankments and trenches run  
ning in various directions  and the river was divided and split up into 
side currents and backwaters and its main course moved from one 
to another mastro antonio brought from dalmatia especially 
skilled cordwainers and collected all the hemp even from the districts 
around in special buildings the master workmen twisted ropes of 
exceptional strength and thickness  greek carpenters  according to 
designs of their own or those drawn up by tosun effendi  built huge 
wooden cranes with pawls  erected them on rafts and thus  with 
these ropes  raised even the heaviest blocks of stone and transported 
them to the piers which  one by one  began to rise out of the bed of 
the river  the transport of each one of these huge blocks from the 
banks to its position m the foundations of the bridge piers lasted 
four days  

watching all this  day after day  year after year  the townspeople 
began to lose count of time and of the real intentions of the builders  
it seemed to them that the construction had not moved an inch for  
ward but was becoming more and more complicated and involved 
in auxiliary and subsidiary workings  and the longer it lasted the less 
it looked like what it was intended to be men who do not work 
themselves and who undertake nothing in their lives easily lose 
patience and fall into error when judging the work of others  the 
visegrad turks again began to shrug their shoulders and wave their 
hands when they talked of the bridge  the chnstians remained silent  
but watched the building work with secret and hostile thoughts  
wishing for its failure as for that of every turkish undertaking  it 
was about this time that the iguman of the monastery at banja near 
priboj wrote on the last blank page of one of his sacred books   be 
it known that about this time mehmed pasha undertook the building 
of a bridge over the drina at visegrad  and great oppression fell upon 
the christian people with hard labour  from the sea came master  

   



masons for three years they built and many aspers were spent in 
vain  they divided the waters into two and into three but they were 
unable to complete the bridge   

years passed  summer and autumn  winter and spring  followed 
one another  the workers and the master masons came and went  
now the whole drina was conquered  not by the bridge but by the 
wooden scaffoldings which looked like a complicated and senseless 
conglomeration of pine beams and planks  from both banks rose 
high wooden cranes fastened on to firmly fixed rafts on both sides 
of the river fires smoked  on which lead was being melted in order 
to be poured into the holes in the stone blocks binding them in  
visibly to one another  

at the end of the third year occurred one of those accidents with  
out which great buildings are rarely completed  the central pier  
which was a little higher and wider at the top than the others  since 
on it the kapia was to rest  was just being completed during the 
transportation of a great stone block  work suddenly came to a stop 
the workmen swarmed about the great rectangular stone which  
held by thick ropes  hung above their heads  the crane had not been 
able to lift it accurately over its place mastro antonio s assistant  the 
arab  rushed impatiently to the spot and began with loud angry cries 
 in that strange composite language which had been evolved in the 
course of years between these men from all parts of the world  to 
give orders to those handling the crane on the waters below  at that 
moment  for no known reason  the ropes gave way and the block 
fell  first by one corner and then with its full weight on to the excited 
arab who had not even troubled to look above his head but only 
down at the water by a strange chance the block fell exactly into 
position  but in its fall it caught the arab and crushed the whole 
lower part of his body  everyone began to rush around  to give the 
alarm  to shout for help  mastro antonio arrived quickly  the 
young negro  after his first unconsciousness  had come to himself  
he groaned through clenched teeth and looked  sad and frightened  
into mastro antonio s eyes frowning and pale  mastro antonio 
gave orders to summon the workmen  bring tools and try to lift the 
block  but all was in vain  a flow of blood suddenly poured out  the 
young man s breath came short and his eyes glazed over  within half 
an hour he died  feverishly clutching mastro antonio s hands in his  

the arab s funeral was a solemn event which was long remem  
bered  all the moslem males turned out to escort him and each for 
a few paces carried the bier on which lay only the upper half of the 
young body  for half had remained under the stone block  mastro 
antonio raised over his grave a fine memorial  made of the same 

   



stone from which the bridge was built the death of this young man  
whom he had befriended as a child living in poverty in ulcinj  where 
a few negro families still lived  had shaken him but the work did not 
cease even for a moment  

that year and the next the winter was mild and work went on 
until mid december  the fifth year of the work began now that 
wide irregular circle of wood  stone  auxiliary equipment and all 
sorts of material began to contract 

on the level space beside the mejdan road the new han  freed 
from its scaffolding  already stood  it was a large building  con  
structed of the same sort of stone of which the bridge was made 
work was still going on both inside and out  but already from a dis  
tance it could be seen how much it excelled m size  the harmony of 
its lines and the solidity of its construction  anything that had ever 
been built or even thought of m the town that building of clear  
yellowish stone  with its roof of dark red tiles and a row of finely 
carved windows  seemed to the townsmen a thing unheard of  which 
from now on must become an integral part of their everyday life  
built by a vezir  it looked as though only vezirs could inhabit it  the 
whole building shone with a sense of grandeur  taste and luxury 
which bewildered them  

about the same time all that formless mass of criss cross beams 
and supports over the river began to be reduced m size and to thin 
out and through it emerged  more and more clearly  the bridge itself  
of lovely banja stone individual workers and small groups were 
still employed on jobs which seemed to the people senseless and un  
connected with the main construction  but by now it was clear even 
to the most doubting of the townsmen that out of all this work the 
bridge itself rose  to a single design and a faultless reckoning  over 
and above all these individual j obs  first the lesser arches  both in 
height and m span  which were nearest to the banks appeared and 
then  one by one  the others were revealed until even the last of them 
was freed of its scaffolding  shovnng the whole bridge with all its 
eleven arches  perfect and wondrous in its beauty  like a new and 
strange feature in the townsmen s eyes  

quick to respond to good or evil  the people of visegrad were now 
ashamed of their doubts and lack of belief  they no longer tried to 
conceal their wonder or to restrain their enthusiasm  passage across 
the bridge was not yet permitted  but they collected on both banks  
especially on the right one where the market place and the greater 
part of the town were  and watched the workers passing across it 
and how they worked at smoothing the stones of the parapet and 
the raised seats of the kapia  the visegrad turks watched this work 

   



by another s hand at another s expense to which for a full five years 
they had given every sort of name and prophesied the worst of 
futures 

 ama  but i always told you  a little moslem hodja from du ce 
said excitedly and gleefully   that nothing escapes the sultan s hand 
and that these men of sense would finally put up what they had in 
mind  but you kept saying  they won t do this  or they can t do that 
now you see they have built it  and what a bridge they have built  
what convenience and what beauty   

everyone approved his words  though no one really remembered 
when he said them  and they all knew very well that he too had ridi  
culed the building and the man who had been building it all of them 
were sincerely enraptured  

 eh  fellows  fellows  see what is rising here  in this town of ours   

 see how great is the vezir s power and foresight  wherever he 
turns his eyes there is profit and blessing   

 yet all this is nothing   added the gay and lively little hod a   there 
will be still finer things you see how they are grooming and decor  
ating it like a horse for a fair   

so they competed in expressions of enthusiasm  searching for new  
better and more high flown words of praise only ahmedaga sheta  
the rich gram merchant  a sullen man and a miser  still looked ask  
ance at the work and those who praised it tall  yellow and wizened  
with black piercing eyes and thin lips that looked as if they were 
glued together  blinking in the fine september sun  he alone did not 
renounce his earlier opinion  for certain men are filled with un  
reasonable hate and envy greater and stronger than anything that 
other men can imagine  to those who enthusiastically praised the 
greatness and permanence of the bridge  saying that it was stronger 
than any fortress  he retorted disdainfully 

 just wait till the floods  one of our real visegrad floods  then you 
will see what will be left of if  

all of them argued bitterly with him and praised those who had 
been working on the bridge  especially arif beg  who with the smile 
of a great lord always on his lips had created such a work as though 
it had been child s play but sheta was firmly determined not to 
acknowledge anything of anyone  

 yes  indeed  but if it had not been for abidaga with his green staff 
and his tyranny and oppression  i ask you what could old baldie 
have done to finish the bridge despite his smile and his hands clasped 
behind his back   

offended at the universal enthusiasm as if it had been a personal 
insult  sheta departed angrily to his shop  to sit in his usual place 

c    



where he could see neither sun nor bridge  nor hear the murmur and 
the movement of the excited throng  

but sheta was an isolated example the joy and enthusiasm of the 
citizens continued to grow and spread to the surrounding villages 
in the early days of october  arif beg ordered a great feast for the 
completion of the bridge this man of lordly manners  of unrelent  
ing severity and strict honesty  who had spent all the monies con  
fided to him for the purpose for which they w ere intended and had 
kept nothing for himself  was regarded by the people as the chief 
personage in this achievement they spoke more of him than of the 
vezir himself so his feast turned out rich and bnlliant  

the overseers and workers received gifts in money and clothing 
and the feast  in which anyone who wished could take part  lasted 
two days  the vezir s health was celebrated in meat and drink  in 
music  dancing and song  horse and foot races were arranged  and 
meat and sweetstuffs divided amongst the poor on the square which 
linked the bridge with the market place  halva was cooked in caul  
drons and served piping hot to the people  that hah a even got as far 
as the villages around the town and whoever ate it wished good 
health to the vezir and long life to his buildings there were children 
who went back fourteen times to the cauldrons until the cooks  
recognizing them  drove them away with their long wooden spoons 
one gipsy child died after eating too much hot halva 

such things were long remembered and spoken about when tales 
were told of the creation of the bridge  the more so since  it seems  
generous vezirs and honest officials in later years died out and such 
feasts became rarer and rarer and at last completel  unknown  until 
in the end they passed into legend with the vilas  with stoja and 
ostoja and similar wonders 

while the feast lasted  and in general all those early days  the 
people crossed the bridge countless times from one bank to the 
other  the children rushed across while their elders walked slowly  
deep in conversation or watching from every point the new views 
open to them from the bridge the helpless  the lame and the sick 
were brought on litters  for no one wanted to be left out or renounce 
their share in this wonder  even the least of the townsmen felt as if 
his powers weie suddenly multiplied  as if some wonderful  super  
human exploit w as brought within the measure of his powers and 
within the limits of everyday life  as if besides the well known ele  
ments of earth  water and sky  one more were open to him  as if by 
some beneficent effort each one of them could suddenly realize one 
of his dearest desires  that ancient dream of man  to go over the 
water and to be master of space 


   



the turkish youths formed a round dance  a kolo  around the 
cauldrons of halva and then led the dance across the bridge  since it 
seemed to them that they were flying and not treading the solid 
earth  the dance wound round in circles about the kapia  the dancers 
beating their heels and stamping on the new flagstones as if to test 
the stoutness of the bridge  around that winding  circling kolo of 
young bodies tirelessly leaping up and down in the same rhthym  the 
children played  running in and out between the dancing feet as if 
through a moving fence  standing m the centre of this kolo which 
was being danced for the first time in their lives on that bridge about 
which there had been so much talk for years  and even on the kapia  
wherein  it was said  the unlucky arab was imprisoned and showed 
himself of nights  enjoying the young men s kolo  they were none 
the less overcome by that fear which the arab himself  when he had 
been alive and working on the bridge  had always instilled into the 
children of the town  on that high  new and strange bridge  it seemed 
to them that they had long forsaken their mothers and their homes 
and were wandering m lands of black people  marvellous buildings 
and strange dances  they trembled  but were unable to keep their 
thoughts from the arab or to abandon the wonderful new kapia 
only some fresh marvel could have distracted their attention  

a certain murat  known as  the dumb one   a dim witted youth 
from the noble family of turkovid from nezuke  who was often the 
butt of the town  suddenly climbed on to the stone parapet of the 
bridge there were shrieks from the children  startled cries from the 
older people  but the idiot  as though under a spell  with outstretched 
arms and head flung back  went along the narrow stones  step by 
step  as though he were not flying above the waters and the depths 
but taking part m a wonderful dance  parallel with him walked a 
crew of urchins and nondescripts urging him on  on the farther side 
of the bridge his brother aliaga waited for him and spanked him 
like a small child  

many people went far down the river  half an hour s walk  to 
kalata or mezalm  and looked thence at the bridge  standing out 
white and delicate with its eleven arches  like a strange arabesque 
on the green waters amid the dark hills  

about this time too a great white plaque was brought  with an 
engraved inscription  and built into the kapia  into that wall of red  
dish stone which rose a good six feet from the parapet of the bridge 
the people gathered around the inscription and looked at it until 
some seminarist or koranic student was found who would  with 
more or less ability  for a coffee or a slice of water melon or even 
for the pure love of allah  read the inscription as best he could 

   



a hundred times those days they spelt out the verses of the tarih  
written by a certain badi  which gave the name and title of the man 
who had made the bequest as well as the fortunate year     ah  that 
is to say      in the christian calendar  when it was completed 
this badi for good money wrote easy and sonorous verses and knew 
well how to foist them upon great men who erected or restored 
great buildings those who knew him  and who were somewhat en  
vious of him  used to say mockingly that the vault of heaven was 
the one and only building on which there was not a tanh from 
badi s pen  but he  despite all his fine earnings  w as a poor famished 
devil continually at odds with that special sort of penury that often 
goes with verse writing like a kind of curse and which no amount of 
pay or salary can assuage  

because of their literary shortcomings  their thick heads and 
lively imaginations  each of the local scholars read and interpreted 
m his own way badi s tanh on the stone plaque which  as every 
text once revealed to the public  stood there  eternal on the eternal 
stone  always and irrevocably exposed to the looks and interpreta  
tions of all men  wise or foolish  evil or well intentioned each one 
of these listeners remembered those lines which best suited his ear 
and his temperament  so what was there  engraved on the hard 
stone in the sight of all men  was repeated from mouth to mouth  
often changed and corrupted into nonsense 
on the stone was written  

 see how mehmed pasha  the greatest among the w ise and great of his time  
mindful of the testament of his heart  by his care and toil 
has built a bridge over the river dnna  

over this water  deep and swift flowmg 
his predecessors had not been able to put up anything 
  pray that by the mercy of allah this bridge will be firm 
and that its existence will be passed in happiness 
and that it will never know sorrow 

for m his lifetime he poured out gold and silver for his bequest 
and no man can say that fortune has been wasted 
which has been spent to such an end  

badi  who has seen this  when the bridge was completed gave this tanh 
 may allah bless this building  this wonderful and beautiful br dge    

but at last the people had eaten their fill and had wondered 
enough  walked enough and had listened to the verses of the inscrip  
tion to their hearts  content  the nine days  wonder became a part 
of their everyday life and they crossed the bridge hurriedly  indif  
ferently  anxiously  absent mindedly as the tumultuous waters that 
flowed beneath it  as if it were only one of the countless roads that 


   



they and their beasts trod beneath their feet  and the plaque with 
the inscription fell as silent as any other stone  

now the road from the left bank of the river was directly con  
nected with that end of the road on the level space on the farther 
side  gone was the dark  worm eaten ferry with its eccentric ferry  
man far below the last arches of the bridge there remained that 
sandy rock and the steep banks equally difficult to ascend or descend 
and on which travellers had waited so despairingly and had called so 
vainly from one bank to the other  all that  together with the stormy 
river  had been surmounted as if by magic men now passed far 
above  as if on wings  straight from one high bank to the other  along 
the wide strong bridge which was as firm and lasting as a mountain 
and which echoed under horses  hooves as if it were made only of a 
thin plaque of stone  

gone too were those wooden water mills and the hovels in which 
travellers in case of need had spent the night  in their place stood the 
firm and luxurious caravanserai which received the travellers who 
daily grew more numerous  they entered the han through a wide 
gateway of harmonious lines  on each side was a large window with 
a grille  not of iron but carved in a single block of limestone in the 
wide rectangular court was space for merchandise and baggage and 
around it were ranged the doors of thirty six rooms  behind  under 
the hillside  were the stables  to general amazement they too were 
of stone  as if built for the sultan s stud  there was not such another 
han from sarajevo as far as adrianople  in it every traveller might 
remain for a day and a night and receive  free of all cost  fire  shelter 
and water for himself  his servants and his beasts  

all this  as the bridge itself  was the bequest of the grand vezir  
mehmed pasha  who had been born more than sixty years before up 
there behind the mountains in the hillside village of sokolovidi  and 
who in his childhood had been taken away with a crowd of other 
serbian peasant boys as blood tribute to stambul  the expenses for 
maintaining the caravanserai came from the vakuf  the religious en  
dowment  which mehmed pasha had founded from the rich proper  
ties seized in the newly conquered territories of hungary  

thus many troubles and inconveniences disappeared with the erec  
tion of the bridge and the foundation of the han  there disappeared 
too that strange pain which the vezir in his childhood had brought 
from bosnia  from the visegrad ferry  those dark shooting pains 
which from time to time had seemed to cut his breast in two  but it 
was not fated that mehmed pasha should live without those pangs 
or long enjoy in his thoughts his visegrad bequest  shortly after the 
final completion of the work  just when the caravanserai had begun 

   



to work properly and the bridge to become known to the world  
mehmed pasha once again felt the  black knife  in his breast  and 
that for the last time 

one friday  when he went with his suite to the mosque  a ragged 
and half demented dervish approached him with his left hand 
stretched out for alms the vezir turned and ordered a member of 
his suite to give them but the dervish then drew a heavy butcher s 
knife from his right sleeve and violently stabbed the vezir between 
the ribs his suite cut the dervish down  but the vezir and his mur  
derer breathed their last at the same moment the dead assassin  big  
red faced  lay with outstretched arms and legs as if still exalted by 
the impulse of his senseless blow  and beside him the grand vezir  
with his robe unbuttoned on his chest and his turban flung far away  
in the last years of his life he had grown thin and bowed  almost 
withered and coarser in feature and now with half bared chest  bare  
headed  bleeding  twisted and crumpled  he looked more like an 
ageing and battered peasant of sokolovidi than the dignitary who 
until a short time before had administered the turkish empire  

months and months passed before the reports of the vezir  s assas  
sination reached the town and then not as a clear and definite fact 
but as a secret whisper which might or might not have been true  for 
in the turkish empire it was not permitted to spread reports or to 
gossip about bad news and tragic events even when they had taken 
place in a nearby country  much less so when they took place on its 
own soil  furthermore  in this case  it was in no one s interest to talk 
much about the grand vezir s death  the party of his adversaries  
which had at last succeeded in overthrowing him  hoped that with 
his solemn funeral every livelier memory of him would also be 
buried and mehmed pasha s kin  collaborators and supporters m 
stambul had for the most part no objection to saying as little as pos  
sible about the one time grand vezir  for in this way their own 
chances of conciliating the new rulers and having their own past 
overlooked were increased 

but the two fine buildings on the drina had already begun to exer  
cise their influence on trade and communications  on the town of 
visegrad and the whole country around  and they went on doing so 
without regard for the living or the dead  for those who were rising 
or those who were falling  the town soon began to move downwards 
from the hillside to the water s edge and expand and develop more 
and more about the bridge and around the caravanserai  which the 
people called the stone han  

thus was born the bridge with its kapia and so the town developed 
around it  after that  for a period of more than     years  its role in 


   



the development of the town and its significance in the life of the 
townspeople was similar to that which we have described above  
and the significance and substance of its existence were  so to speak  
in its permanence its shining line in the composition of the town 
did not change  any more than the outlines of the mountains against 
the sky in the changes and the quick burgeoning of human genera  
tions  it remained as unchanged as the waters that flowed beneath it  
it too grew old  naturally  but on a scale of time that was much 
greater not only than the span of human existence but also than the 
passing of a whole series of generations  so that its ageing could not 
be seen by human eye  its life  though mortal in itself  resembled 
eternity for its end could not be perceived  


   



v 




t he first century passed  a time long and mortal for men and 
for many of their works  but insignificant for great build  
ings  well conceived and firmly based  and the bridge with 
its kapia and the nearby caravanserai stood and served as 
they had on their first day so too would a second century have 
passed over them  with its changes of seasons and human genera  
tions  and the buildings would have lasted unchanged  but what time 
could not do  the unstable and unpredictable influence of faraway 
affairs did 

at that time  at the end of the seventeenth century  much was 
sung  spoken and whispered about hungary  w hence the turkish 
armies after a hundred years of occupation w ere about to withdraw 
many bosnian spahis  landowners w ho held their lands on military 
tenure  had left their bones on hungarian soil  defending their pro  
perties m the battles preceding the withdrawal they were  it might 
be thought  the lucky ones for many of the other spahis returned as 
bare as a finger to their former bosnian homeland  where there 
awaited them sparse soil and a straitened and penurious life after the 
rich lordliness and spaciousness of life on the great hungarian 
estates the far off and uncertain echo of all this penetrated as far 
as visegrad  but no one there could ever have imagined that distant  
hungary  a land of legend  could have any connection with the real  
everyday life of the town  but with the turkish retreat from 
hungary there remained outside the frontiers of the empire also 
those properties of the vakul  the religious endowment  from the 
revenues of which the caravanserai at visegrad was maintained  

both the people of the town and the travellers who had made use 
of the stone han for the past loo years had become accustomed to 
it and had never even considered by what means it had been main  
tained  how the revenues had been founded  or from what source 
they came  all had made use of it  profiting by it as from a blessed 
and fertile roadside orchard which was both nobody s and every  
body s  they repeated mechanically  peace to the vezir s soul  but 


   



did not stop to think that the vezir had died loo years before  nor 
did they ask who now preserved and defended the imperial lands 
and the vakuf who could ever have dreamt that the affairs of the 
woi id were in such dependence upon one another and were linked 
together across so great a distance  so at first no one in the town even 
noticed that the income of the ban had dried up  the attendants 
worked and the ban received travellers as before it was thought that 
the money for its upkeep had been delayed  as had happened before  
but the months passed and even the years  and the money did not 
come the mute elia  the administrator of the bequest   dauthodja 
mutavelic  for the people so called him after his appointment and the 
nickname stuck  applied to everyone he could think of  but received 
no reply the travellers had to look after their own needs and cleaned 
up the ban as much as they found necessary for their own conven  
ience  but as each one went his way he left behind manure and dis  
order for others to clean up and put right  even as he himself had 
tidied up whatever he had found dirty and in disorder  but after each 
traveller there remained  ust a little more dirt than he himself had 
found  

dauthodja did all that he could to save the ban and keep it going  
first he spent his own money and then he began to borrow from his 
relatives so he patched things up from year to year and kept the 
precious building in its former beauty to those who reproached him 
for ruining himself trying to preserve what could not be preserved  
he replied that he was investing the money well for he gave it 
as a loan to god and that he  the muteveha  should be the last to 
desert this bequest which it seemed all others had deserted and 
abandoned  

this wuse and godfearing  stubborn and obstinate man  whom the 
town long remembered  allowed no one to turn him from his vain 
effort working devotedly  he had long become reconciled to the idea 
that our destiny on this earth lies in the struggle against decay  death 
and dissolution and that man must persevere in this struggle  even 
if it were completely in vain sitting before the ban which was fall  
ing into dissolution before his eyes  he replied to all those who tried 
to dissuade him or pitied him  

there is no need to feel sorry for me for all of us die only once  
whereas great men die twuce  once when they leave this world and a 
second time when their lifework disappears   

when he was no longer able to pay day labourers  he himself  old 
as he was  rooted up the weeds around the ban with his own hands 
and earned out mmoi repairs to the building so it was that death 
oveitook him one day when he had climbed up to repair a cracked 


   



slate on the roof it was natural that a small town hodja could not 
maintain what a grand vezir had founded and which historical 
events had sentenced to disaster 

after dauthodja s death the han rapidly began to fall into rums 
signs of decay appeared everywhere the gutters began to crack and 
to smell nasty  the loof to let in the rains  the doois and windows the 
winds  and the stables to be choked with manuie and weeds but 
from without the perfect building still looked unchanged  calm and 
indestructible in its beauty those great arched windows on the 
ground floor  with grilles as delicate as lace cut in soft stone from a 
single block  looked peacefully out upon the world  but the simpler 
windows on the floor above already showed signs of poverty  neglect 
and internal disorder little by little travellers began to avoid spend  
ing the night in the town or  if they did  stayed at ustamujid s inn and 
paid for their night s lodging they came more and more rarely to 
the caravanserai  even though they had not to pay but only to wish 
peace to the vezir s soul at last  when it become clear that the 
money would never come  everyone abandoned any pretence to care 
for the building  even the new muteveha  and the caravanserai stayed 
mute and deserted and fell into ruin and disrepair as do all buildings 
in which no one lives and which no one looks after  wild grasses  
weeds and thistles grew around it  ravens nested on the roof and 
crows gathered there in dense black flocks 

thus before its time and unexpectedly forsaken  all such things 
seem to happen unexpectedly  the vezir s stone han began to disin  
tegrate and fall to pieces 

but if the caravanserai  due to unusual circumstances  was forced 
to betray its mission and fall into ruin before its time  the bridge  
which needed neither supervision nor maintenance  remained up  
right and unchanged  linking the two banks and bearing across 
the river burdens dead and alive  as it had in the first days of 
its existence  

in its walls the birds nested and in the invisible cracks opened by 
time grew little tufts of grass  the yellowish porous stone of which 
the bndge was built hardened and contracted under the alternate in  
fluence of moisture and of heat eternally beaten by the winds which 
blew up and down the river valley  washed by the rains and dried by 
the fierce heats of summer  that stone in time turned white with the 
dull whiteness of parchment and shone in the twilight as if lighted 
from within the great and frequent floods  which were a heavy and 
continual menace to the town  were unable to do anything against 
it  they came every year  in spring and autumn  but all were not 
dangerous and fateful to the town beside the bridge every year  once 


   



or perhaps twice  the drina rose in tumult and its muddied waters 
roared down  bearing through the arches of the bridge torn up fences 
from the fields  uprooted stumps of trees  and daik earthy waters 
filled with leaves and branches from the riverside forests  the court  
yards  gardens and storerooms of the houses nearest the river suf  
fered  but everything ended there at irregular intervals of between 
twenty and thirty years came great floods which were afterwards 
remembered as one remembers insurrections or wars and were long 
used as a date from which to reckon time  to calculate the ages of 
citizens or the term of men s lives  tive or six years before the great 
flood        during the great flood   

after these great floods little movable property remained in that 
larger part of the town which lay on the low sandy strip between the 
drina and the rzav  such a flood threw the whole town several years 
back  that generation spent the rest of its life m repairing the damage 
and the misfortune left by the  great flood   to the end of their lives 
men  talking amongst themselves  recalled the terror of that autumn 
night when  in the chill ram and hellish wind  to the light of an occa  
sional lantern  they would take out their goods  each from his own 
shop  and carry them to higher ground at mejdan and there store 
them in the shops and warehouses of others when the next day  in 
the cloudy dawn  they looked down from the hillside on the town 
that they loved as strongly and as unconsciously as their own blood  
and saw the darkened muddied waters rushing through the streets 
at roof level  they would try to guess whose house it was from which 
the foaming waters were noisily tearing the roof plank by plank and 
whose house still remained upright  

on feast days and festivals and during the nights of ramazan the 
grey haired toilworn and anxious fathers of families would grow 
lively and talkative when the conversation turned to the greatest 
and hardest event of their lives  to the  great flood   after the interval 
of fifteen or twenty years in which they had once more restored their 
fortunes and  their homes  the flood was recalled as something great 
and terrible  near and dear to them  it was an intimate bond between 
the men of that generation who were still living  for nothing brings 
men closer together than a common misfortune happily overcome 
they felt themselves closely bound by the memory of that bygone 
disaster  they loved to recall memories of the hardest blow dealt 
them in their lives their recollections were inexhaustible and they 
lepeated them continually  amplified by memory and repetition  
they looked into one another s eyes  scelerotic and with yellowing 
whites  and saw there what the younger men could not even suspect 
they were carried away by their own words and drowned all their 


   



present everyday troubles in the recollection of those greater ones 
which they had experienced so long ago 

sitting in the warm rooms of their homes through which that 
flood had at one time passed  they recounted for the hundredth time 
with special enjoyment moving and tragic scenes and the more 
harrowing and painful the recollection the greater pleasure was there 
in recollecting it seen through tobacco smoke or a glass of plum 
brandy  such scenes were often transformed by distance and imagi  
nation  magnified and embellished  but not one of them ever noticed 
that this was so and would have sworn that it had in fact so hap  
pened  for they all shared in this unconscious exaggeration  

thus there still lived a few old men w ho remembered the last  great 
flood   about which they could still speak among themselves  repeat  
ing to the younger men that there were no longer such disasters as 
in time past  but no such blessings and good living either  

one of the very greatest of all these floods  which occurred in the 
second half of the eighteenth century  was especially long remem  
bered and became the subject of countless tales  

in that generation  as the older men later said  there was practi  
cally no one who remembered the last great flood well none the 
less  on those rainy autumn days all were on the alert  knowing that 
 the waters were hostile   they emptied the warehouses closest to the 
river and wandered by night  by the light of lanterns  along the 
banks to listen to the roar of the waters  for the older men affirmed 
that they could tell by some special moaning of the waters whether 
the flood to come would be one of those ordinary ones which visited 
the town every year and caused minor damage  or whether it would 
be one of those  happily rare  which flooded both the bridge and the 
town and carried away everything that was not on firm foundations 
next day the drina did not rise and the town that night slept soundly  
for men were tired out from lack of sleep and the excitement of the 
night before so it was that the waters deceived them that night the 
rzav rose suddenly in a manner never before remembered and  red 
with mud  piled up at its confluence with the drina thus the two 
rivers overwhelmed the whole town 

suljaga osmanagid  one of the richest turks in the town  then 
owned a thoroughbred arab horse  a chestnut of great value and 
beauty as soon as the reinforced drina began to rise  two hours be  
fore it overflowed into the streets  this chestnut began to neigh and 
did not calm down until it had awakened the stable boys and its 
owner and until they had taken it out of its stall which was beside the 
liver so the greater part of the inhabitants were awakened  under 
the chill ram and the raging wind of the dark october night began a 

   



flight and a saving of all that could be saved half dressed  the people 
waded up to their knees  carrying on their backs their wakened and 
complaining children at every moment dull crashes could be heard 
when the tree stumps which the drina washed down from the 
flooded forests struck against the piers of the stone bridge 

up at mejdan  which the waters had never in any circumstances 
been able to reach  windows were all alight and flickering lanterns 
danced and quivered in the darkness all the houses were open to 
welcome those who had suffered and who came drenched and de  
spondent with their children or their most precious belongmgs in 
their arms in the stables burned fires by which those unable to find 
a place in the houses could dry themselves  

the leading merchants of the town  after they had placed the 
people in the houses  turkish in turkish homes and christian and 
jewish in christian homes  gathered in the great ground floor room 
of hadji ristid s house there were the mukhtars  the moslem 
leaders  and the kmets  the christian headmen  of all the quarters  
exhausted and wet to the skin  after having wakened and moved to 
safe quarters all their fellow citizens  turks  christians and jews 
mingled together  the force of the elements and the weight of com  
mon misfortune brought all these men together and bridged  at least 
for this one evening  the gulf that divided one faith from the other 
and  especially  the rayah from the turks  suljaga osmanagid  petar 
bogdanovid  mordo papo  the big  taciturn and witty pansh priest 
pop mihailo  the fat and serious mula ismet  the visegrad hodja  and 
elias levi  known as hadji liacho  the jewish rabbi well known even 
far beyond the town for his sound judgment and open nature  there 
were about ten others  from all three faiths  all were wet  pale  with 
clenched jaws  but outwardly calm  they sat and smoked and talked 
of what had been done to save the people and of what still remained 
to be done  every moment younger people entered  streaming with 
water  who reported that everything living had been taken to 
mejdan and to the fortress and put in houses there  turkish and 
christian  and that the waters down in the valley were still rising 
and invading street after street  

as the night passed  and it passed slowly and seemed enormous    
growing greater and greater like the waters in the valley   the leaders 
and rich men of the town began to warm themselves over coffee and 
plum brandy  a warm and close circle formed  like a new existence  
created out of realities and yet itself unreal  which was not what it 
had been the day before nor what it would be the day after  but like 
a transient island in the flood of time  the conversation rose and 
strengthened and changed subject  they avoided speaking of past 


   



floods known only m tales  but spoke of other things that had no 
connection with the waters and with the disaster which was at that 
moment taking place 

desperate men make desperate efforts to appear calm and indif  
ferent  almost casual by some tacit superstitious agreement and by 
the unwritten but sacred laws of patronal dignity and business order 
which have existed since olden times  each considered it his duty to 
make an effort and at that moment at least externally to conceal his 
fear and his anxieties in face of a disaster against which he could do 
nothing and to talk in a light tone about unrelated things 

but just as they began to grow calm in this conversation and to 
find in it a moment of forgetfulness  and thereby the lest and energy 
that they would need so greatly in the day to come  a man entered  
bringing with him kosta baranac  that young merchant was wet 
through  muddied to the knees and dishevelled dazzled by the light 
and confused by the numbers present  he looked at them as if in a 
dream  wiping the water fiom his face with his open hand  they 
made room for him and offeied him plum brandy  which he was un  
able to raise to his lips  his whole body shivered a whisper ran 
through the room that he had tried to leap into the dark current that 
now flowed in a sandy torrent immediately above the spot where 
his barns and granaries had been  

he was a young man  a recent settler  who had been brought to 
the town twenty years before as an apprentice  but had later mar  
ried into a good family and become a merchant a peasant s son  he 
had in the last few years by daring speculation and ruthless exploita  
tion become rich  richer than many of the leading families of the 
town but he was not used to loss and was unable to support disaster 
that autumn he had bought large quantities of plums and walnuts  
far beyond his real resources  reckoning that in wdnter he would be 
able to control the price of both dried plums and walnuts and so 
clear his debts and make a good profit  as he had done in previous 
years now he was ruined 

some time was to pass before the pipression made on them by the 
sight of this ruined man could be dispelled  since all of them  some 
more some less  had been hit by this flood and only by inborn dignity 
had they been able to control themselves better than this upstart  

the oldest and most prominent amongst them once again turned 
the conversation to casual matters they began to tell long stories of 
former times  which had no sort of connection with the disaster that 
had drawn them hither and surrounded them on all sides  

they drank hot plum brandy and embarked on recollections of 
earlier days  about the eccentric characters of the town and every 

   



kind of strange and unusual event pop mihailo and hadji liacho set 
the example  when the talk inevitably returned to earlier floods  
they recalled only what was pleasant or comical  or at least seemed 
so after so many years  as if they wanted to cast a spell upon the 
waters and to defy the flood  

they talked of pop jovan  who had once been parish priest here  
who his panshioners had said was a good man but did not have  a 
lucky hand  and that god had paid little heed to his prayers  

at the time of the summer droughts which often luined the whole 
harvest  pop jovan had regularly led a procession and read the 
prayers for ram  but the only result was still greater drought and 
stifling heat when one autumn  after such a dry summer  the drina 
began to rise and threaten a general flood  pop jovan had gone out 
to the banks  collected the people  and began to read a prayer that 
the ram should cease and the waters recede  then a certain jokid  a 
drunkard and ne er do well  reckoning that god always did exactly 
the opposite from what pop jovan prayed for  shouted 

 not that one  father  read the summer one  the one for ram  that 
will help the waters dry up   

fat and well fed ismet effendi spoke of his predecessors and their 
struggles with the floods at one of these disasters long ago a pair of 
the visegrad hodjas went out to read a prayer to stay the disaster 
one of these hodjas had a house m the lower part of the town  the 
other one on the hillside where the waters could not reach the first 
to read was the hodja from the house on the hillside but the waters 
showed no sign of receding  then a gipsy whose house was already 
half disintegrated m the waters shouted  

 ama  fellows  let the hodja from the market place  whose house 
is under water like ours  read  can t you see that that fellow  from 
the hill only reads with half his heart   

hadji liacho  red faced and smiling  with riotous tufts of white 
hair showing from under his unusually shallow fez  laughed at 
everything and said mockingly to the priest and hodja  

 don t talk too much about prayers against floods  or else our 
people might remember and drive all three of us out m this down  
pour to read prayers for them   

so they ranged story against story  all insignificant in themselves 
but each with a meaning for them and their generation though in  
comprehensible to others  harmless recollections which evoked the 
monotonous  pleasant yet hard life of the townsmen  their own life  
though all these things had changed long ago they still remained 
closely bound up with their lives  although far from the drama of 
that night which had brought them together in that fantastic circle  


   



thus the town s leaders  accustomed from childhood to misfor  
tunes of every kind  dominated the night of the great flood and found 
enough strength in themselves to jest in fate ol the disaster which 
had come upon them and thus mastered the misety that they were 
not able to avoid  

but within themselves they were all greatly anxious and each of 
them  beneath all the jokes and laughter at misfortune  as if under 
a mask  turned over and over in his mind anxious thoughts and 
listened continually to the roar of the waters and the wind from the 
town below  where he had left all that he possessed the next day in 
the morning  after a night so spent  they looked down from mejdan 
to the plain below where their houses were under w ater  some only 
half submerged and others covered to the root then for the first and 
last time in their lives they saw their town w ithout a bridge the 
waters had risen a good thirty feet  so that the wide high arches 
were covered and the waters flowed over the roadway of the bridge 
which was hidden beneath them  only that elevated part on which 
the kapia had been built showed above the surface of the troubled 
waters which flowed about it like a tiny w aterfall 

but two days later the waters suddenly fell  the skies cleared and 
the sun broke through  as warm and nch as it does on some october 
days in this fertile land on that lovely day the town looked pitiable 
and terrible  the houses of the gipsies and the poorer folk on the 
banks were bent over in the direction of the current  many of them 
roofless and with the mud and clay of their walls washed away  dis  
playing only a black trellis of willow branches so that they looked 
like skeletons  in the unfenced courtyards the houses of the i icher 
townsmen gaped open with staring windows  on each a line of red  
dish mud showed how deeply it had been flooded many stables had 
been washed away and granaries overturned in the lower shops 
there was mud to the knees  and in that mud all the goods that had 
not been taken away in time  in the streets were whole trees rooted 
up and brought there by the waters from no one knew where  and 
the swollen corpses of drowned animals 

that was their town  to which they must now descend and go on 
with their lives  but between the flooded banks  above the waters 
which still raged noisily  stood the bridge  white and unchanged in 
the sun  the waters now reached halfway up the piers and the bridge 
seemed as if it were in some other and deeper river than that which 
usually flowed beneath it  along the parapet still remained deposits 
of mud which had now dried and were cracking in the sun  and on 
the kapia was piled up a whole heap of small branches and rubbish 
from the river  but all that in no way altered the appearance of the 

 o 



bridge  which alone had passed through the flood unaltered and 
emerged from it unscathed 

every man in the town set to work at once to repair the damage 
and no one had time to think of the meaning of the victory of the 
bridge  but going about his affairs in that ill fated town in which the 
waters had destroyed or at least damaged everything  he knew that 
there was something in his life that overcame every disaster and that 
the bridge  because of the strange harmony of its forms and the 
strong and invisible power of its foundations  would emerge from 
every test unchanged and imperishable  

the winter which then began was a hard one  everything that had 
been stored in courtyards and barns  wood  wheat  hay  the flood had 
carried away  houses  stables and fences had to be repaired and fresh 
goods had to be obtained on credit to replace those which had been 
destroyed in warehouses and shops kosta baranac  who had suf  
fered more than any  because of his overbold speculations with 
plums  did not outlive the winter  but died of mortification and 
shame he left his young children almost penniless and a number of 
small but widespread debts in all the villages  he was recalled in the 
memory of the town as a man who had overtaxed his strength  

but by the next summer the recollection of the great flood had 
begun to pass into the memory of the older men  where it would live 
long  while the younger people sat singing and talking on the smooth 
white stone kapia over the water which flowed far below them and 
accompanied their songs with its murmurings forgetfulness heals 
everything and song is the most beautiful manner of forgetting  for 
in song man feels only what he loves  

so  on the kapia  between the skies  the river and the hills  genera  
tion after generation learnt not to mourn overmuch what the 
troubled waters had borne away they entered there into the un  
conscious philosophy of the town  that life was an incomprehensible 
marvel  since it was incessantly wasted and spent  yet none the less 
it lasted and endured  like the bridge on the drina   


 i 



vi 




m s well as floods there were also other onslaughts on the bridge 
   and its kapia they were caused by the development of events 
and the course of human conflicts  but they could do even 
a less than the unchained waters to harm the bridge or 
change it permanently  

at the beginning of last century serbia rose m revolt this town on 
the very frontier of bosnia and serbia had always been in close con  
nection and permanent touch with everything that took place in 
serbia and grew with it  like a nail and its finger   nothing that hap  
pened in the vi egrad district  drought  sickness  oppression or re  
volt  could be a matter of indifference to those in the uzice district  
and vice versa but at first the affair seemed distant and insignificant  
distant  because it was taking place on the farther side ot the bel  
grade pashaluk  insignificant since rumours of revolt were no sort of 
novelty  ever since the empire had existed there had been such 
rumours  for there is no rule without revolts and conspiracies  even 
as there is no property without work and worry  but m time the re  
volt in serbia began to affect the life of the whole bosnian pashaluk 
more and more  and especially the life of this town which was only 
an hour s march from the frontier  

as the struggle in serbia grew  more and more was demanded from 
the bosnian turks  they were asked to send men to the army and to 
contribute to its equipment and supply  the army and the commis  
sariat sent into serbia passed to a great extent through the town that 
brought in its tram expenses and inconveniences and dangers not 
only for the turks  but especially for the serbs who were suspected  
persecuted and fined in those years more than ever before  finally  
one summer  the revolt spread to these districts  making a detour 
around uzice  the insurgents came to within two hours  march of 
the town  there  at veletovo  they destroyed lufti beg s fortified 
farmhouse by cannon fire and burnt a number of turkish houses at 
cmice  

there were in the town both turks and serbs who swore that they 

   



had heard with their own ears the rumbling of  karageorge s gun  
 naturally with completely opposite feelings  but even if it were a   
matter for doubt whether the echo of the serb insurrectionists  gun 
could be heard as far as the town  for a man often thmks that he can 
hear what he is afraid of or what he hopes for  there could be no 
doubt about the fires which the insurgents lit by night on the bare 
and rocky crest of panos between veletovo and gostilje  on which 
the huge isolated pines could be counted from the town with the 
naked eye  both turks and serbs saw the fires clearly and looked at 
them attentively  although both pretended not to have noticed them  
from darkened windows and from the shadows of dense gardens  
both took careful note of when and where they were lighted and ex  
tinguished the serbian women crossed themselves m the darkness 
and wept from inexplicable emotion  but in their tears they saw re  
flected those fires of insurrection even as those ghostly flames which 
had once fallen upon radisav s grave and which their ancestors al  
most three centuries before had also seen through their tears from 
that same mejdan 

those flickering and uneven flames  scattered along the dark back  
ground of the summer night  wherein skies and mountains merged  
seemed to the serbs like some new constellation in which they 
eagerly read bold presentiments and  shivering  guessed at their fate 
and at coming events for the turks they were the first waves of a 
sea of fire which was spreading there m serbia and which  even as 
they watched  splashed agamst the mountains above the town  in 
those summer nights the wishes and the prayers of both circled 
around those flames  but in different directions  the serbs prayed to 
god that these saving flames  like those which they had always car  
ried in their hearts and carefully concealed  should spread to these 
mountains  while the turks prayed to allah to halt their progress 
and extinguish them  to frustrate the seditious designs of the infidel 
and restore the old order and the peace of the true faith  the nights 
were filled with prudent and passionate whisperings in which pulsed 
invisible waves of the most danng dreams and wishes  the most im  
probable thoughts and plans which triumphed and broke in the blue 
 kness overhead  next day at dawn  turks and serbs went out to 
work and met one another with dull and expressionless faces  
greeted one another and talked together with those hundred or so 
commonplace words of provincial courtesy which had from times 
past circulated in the town and passed from one to another like 
counterfeit coin which none the less makes communication both 
possible and easy 

when  soon after the feast of st elias  the fires disappeared from 

   



panes and the revolt was pushed back from the uzice district  once 
again neither the one side nor the other showed their feelings and it 
would really be difficult to say what weie the tiue feelings of either 
side  the turks weie gratified that the revolt w as now far aw ay from 
them and hoped that it would be entirely extinguished and would 
end there where all godless and evil enterprises ended but none the 
less that gratification was incomplete and overshadowed for it was 
hard to forget so close a danger many of them for long after saw in 
their dreams those fantastic insurgent files like a showier of sparks 
on all the hills around the town or heard karageorge s gun  not as a 
distant echo but as a devastating cannonade which brought rum 
with it  the serbs  however  as was natural  remained disillusioned 
and disappointed after the withdrawal of the fires on panos but in the 
depth of their hearts  in that true and ultimate depth which is re  
vealed to no one  there remained the memory of what had taken 
place and the consciousness that what has once been can be again  
there remained too hope  a senseless hope  that great asset of the 
downtrodden for those who rule and must oppress in order to rule 
must work according to reason  and if  earned away by their pas  
sions or driven by an adversary  they go beyond the limits of reason  
able action  they start down the slippery slope and thereby reveal the 
commencement of their own downfall whereas those who are 
downtrodden and exploited make equal use of then reason and un  
reason for they are but two different kinds of arms m the continual 
struggle  now underground  now open  against the oppressor 
in those times the importance of the bridge as the one sure link 
between the bosnian pashaluk and serbia was greatly increased  
there was now a permanent military force in the town  which was 
not disbanded even m the long periods of truce  and which guarded 
the bridge over the drina  to carry out this task as well as possible 
with the minimum of labour  the soldiers began to erect a wooden 
blockhouse in the centre of the bridge  a monstrous erection crude in 
shape  position  and the material of which it was made  but all the 
armies of the world put up  for their own special aims and momen  
tary needs  buildings such as this which  later on  from the point of 
view of normal peaceful life appear both absurd and incomprehen  
sible   it was a real two storeyed house  clumsy and hideous  made of 
rough beams and unplaned planks  with a free passage like a tunnel 
beneath it  the blockhouse was raised up and rested on stout beams  
so that it straddled the bridge and was supported only at its two 
ends on the kapia  one on the left and the other on the right terrace  
beneath it there was a free passage for carts  horses and pedestrians  
but from above  from the floor on which the guards slept and to 

   



which led an uncovered stairway  it was possible to inspect all who 
passed  to examine papers and baggage and  at any moment  should 
the need arise  to stop them  

that indeed altered the appearance of the bridge  the lovely 
kapia was concealed by the wooden structure which squatted over 
it with its wooden beams like some sort of gigantic bird 

the day the blockhouse was ready it still smelt strongly of 
resinous wood and steps echoed in its emptiness  the guards at once 
took up their quarters by dawn on the first day the blockhouse  like 
a trap  already claimed its first victim  

in the low and rosy sun of early morning there collected beneath 
it the soldiers and a few armed townsmen  turks  who mounted 
guard around the town by night and so helped the army in the midst 
of this group stood a little old man  a vagabond religious pilgrim  
something between a monk and a beggar  but mild and peaceful  
somehow clean and sweet m his poverty  easy and smiling despite 
his white hair and lined face  he was an eccentric old fellow named 
jelisije from cajnice for many years he had been wandering about  
always mild  solemn and smiling  visiting churches and monasteries  
religious meetings and festivals  he prayed  did penance and fasted  
earlier the turkish authorities had paid no attention to him and re  
garded him as a feeble minded and religious man  letting him go 
where he would and say what he liked but now  due to the insurrec  
tion in serbia  new times had come and harsher measures prevailed  
a few turkish families had arrived in the town whose property had 
been destroyed by the insurgents  they spread hatred and called for 
vengeance guards were everywhere supervision was intensified  the 
local turks were anxious  filled with rancour and ill will and looked 
on everyone bloodthirstily and with suspicion 

the old man had been travelling along the road from rogatica and 
by bad luck was the first traveller on the day when the blockhouse 
had been completed and the first guards had taken up their posts 
there  in fact he had chosen the very worst time  for the day had not 
fully dawned he bore before him  as a man carries a lighted candle  
a sort of thick stick decorated with strange signs and letters the 
blockhouse swallowed him up like a spider does a fly  they inter  
rogated him curtly they demanded who he was  what he was doing 
and whence he came  and commanded him to explain the decora  
tions and writing on his staff he replied freely and openly  even to 
questions that had not been asked him  as if speaking before the last 
judgment of god and not before a group of evil turks  he said that 
he was no one and nothing  a traveller on this earth  a transient in a 
transient world  a shadow in the sun  but that he passed his few and 

 s 



short days m prayer and in going from monastery to monastery  until 
he had visited all the holy places  all the bequests and the tombs of 
the serbian tsars and nobles as to the signs and letters on his staff 
they represented the times of serbian freedom and greatness  past 
and future for  said the old man  smiling gently and timidly  the day 
of resurrection was coming soon and  judging from what he had 
read in books and from what might be seen on the earth and in the 
skies  it was now quite near the kingdom was reborn  redeemed by 
trials and founded on truth 

 i know that it is not pleasant  gentlemen  for you to have to listen 
to these things and that i should not even speak of them before you  
but you have stopped me and told me that i should tell you the whole 
truth  wherever it may lead god is truth and god is one  and now  
i beg you  let me go on my way for i am due today at banja  at the 
monastery of the holy trinity  

the interpreter shefko translated  struggling in vain to find in his 
poor knowledge of the turkish language equivalents for abstract 
ideas  the captain of the guard  a sickly anatolian  still only half 
awake  listened to the confused and disconnected words of the trans  
lator and from time to time threw a glance at the old man who  with  
out fear or evil thoughts  looked back at him and confirmed with 
his eyes that everything was just as the interpreter had said  though 
he knew not a word of turkish  somewhere in the back of his mind 
it was clear to the captain that this man was some sort of half witted 
infidel dervish  a good natured and harmless madman and in the 
old man s staff  which they had already cut through in several 
places thinking that it was hollow and that messages were concealed 
in it  they found nothing  but in shefko s translation the old man s 
words seemed suspicious  smelled of politics and seditious intent 
the captain  for his part  would have let this poor dim witted 
creature go his way  but the rest of the soldiers and civil guards had 
gathered together there and were listening to the interrogation  
there was his sergeant tahir  an evil man  sullen and rheumy eyed  
who had already several times slandered him to his chief and 
accused him of lack of care and severity  then too there was that 
shefko  who in his translation was obviously putting the worst pos  
sible construction on the old man s exalted phrases and who loved to 
stick his nose into everything and carry tales even when there was 
nothing in them  and was ever ready to give or to confirm an evil 
report  then too there were those turks from the town  volunteers  
who went their rounds sullenly and self importantly  arrested sus  
picious characters and interfered needlessly in his official duties 
they were all there and all of them  these days  were as if drunk 

   



wdth bitterness  from desire for vengeance and longed to punish and 
to kill whomsoever they could  since they could not punish or kill 
those whom they wished  he did not understand them  nor did he 
approve of them  but he saw that they were all agreed that the block  
house must have its victim this first morning  he suspected that be  
cause of their intoxication of bitterness he might be the one to suffer 
if he opposed their wishes the thought that he might have un  
pleasantness because of this mad old fool seemed to him intolerable  
and the old man with his tales of the serbian empire would not in 
any case get very far among the turks of the district who  these days  
were like a swarm of angry bees  let the troubled waters carry him 
away  even as they had brought him here     

as soon as the old man had been bound and the captain was pre  
paring to go into the town so as not to have to watch the execution  
some turkish policemen and a few civilians appeared  leading a 
poorly dressed seibian youth  his clothing was torn and his face and 
hands scratched this was a certain mile  a poor devil from lijesko  
who lived quite alone in a water mill at osojnica  he might have 
been nineteen at most  strong and bursting with health  

that morning before sunrise mile placed some barley in the mill 
to be ground and then opened the big millrace and went into the 
forest to cut wood  he brandished his axe and cut the soft alder 
branches like straws he enjoyed the morning freshness and the ease 
with which the wood fell before his axe his own movements were 
a pleasure to him  but his axe was sharp and the thin wood too frail 
for the force that was in him something within him swelled his 
breast and drove him to shout aloud at each movement  his cries be  
came more and more frequent and connected  mile who  like all men 
of lijesko  had no ear and no idea of how to sing  sang and shouted 
in the thick and shady forest without thinking of anything and for  
getting where he was  he began to sing what he had heard others 
singing 

at that time  when serbia had risen in revolt  the people had made 
of the old song  

 when ahbeg was a young beg 
a maiden bore his standard     

a new song 

 when karageorge was a young beg 
a maiden bore his standard       

in that great and strange struggle  which had been waged in 
bosnia for centuries between two faiths  for land and power and 
their own conception of life and order  the adversaries had taken 
from each other not only women  horses and arms but also songs  

   



many a verse passed from one to the other as the most precious of 
booty 

this song  then  was one recentlv sung among the serbs  but 
stealthily and m secret  m closed houses  at family feasts or in dis  
tant pastures where a turk might not set foot for   ears at a time and 
where a man  at the price of loneliness and poverty in the wilds  
might live as he wished and sing what he liked and it w as just this 
song that mile  the mill attendant  had thought fit to sing in the forest 
just below the road along   hlch the turks of olujac and orahovac 
passed on their way to the maiket in the town 

dawn had just touched the crests of the mountains and there  m 
that shady place  it was still quite dark mile w as all w et wuth the 
dew but warm from a good night s sleep  hot bread and w ork he 
brandished his axe and struck the slender alder near its root but the 
tree only bent and bow cd like a young bride w ho kisses the hand of 
the  kum  who leads her to marriage the aldei was sprinkled with 
cold dew like a fine ram and remained bent  for it could not fall be  
cause of the thickness of the greenery around then he cut off the 
green branches wdth his axe in one hand as if play mg while he was 
doing this he sang at the top of his voice pronouncing certain of the 
words wuth enjoyment  karageorge  was something vague but 
strong and daring   maiden  and  standard  were also things unknown 
to him  but things w hich m some way answered to his most intimate 
dreams  to have a giil of his own and to bear a standard in any case 
there was a sweetness in pronouncing such wwds and all the 
strength within him drove him on to pronounce them clearly and 
countless times over his utterance of them seemed to renew his 
strength making him repeat them still more loudly  

so sang mile at the break of day until he had cut and trimmed the 
branches for which he had come then he went down the w et slope 
dragging his fresh burden behind him  there were some turks m 
front of the mill they had tethered their horses and were waiting 
for someone  there were ten of them he felt himself again  as he 
had been before he had set out to get the wood  clumsy  ragged and 
embarrassed  without karageorge before his eyes  without a girl or a 
standard near him  the turks waited until he had put down his axe  
then fell on him from all sides and after a short struggle bound him 
with a halter and took him to the town  on their way they beat him 
and kicked him in the groin  asking him where was his karageorge 
now and saying evil words about his girl and his standard  

under the blockhouse on the kapia where they had just bound the 
half witted old man some of the town ne er do wells had joined the 
soldiers even though it had only just dawned amongst them were 

   



a number of refugees from serbia whose homes there had been burnt 
down  all were armed and wore a solemn expression as though a 
great event or a decisive battle were in question their emotion rose 
with the rising sun  the sun rose rapidly  amid shining mists down 
there on the skyline above goles the turks waited for the terrified 
youth as if he had been a revolutionary leader  though he was ragged 
and miserable and had been brought from the left bank of the drina 
where there was no insurrection  

the turks from olujac and orahovac  exasperated by the arro  
gance which they were unable to believe was not intentional  bore 
witness that the young man had been singing in a provocative man  
ner beside the road songs about karageorge and the infidel fighters  
he  frightened  in wet rags  scratched and beaten  his eyes filled with 
emotion that made him seem to squint  watched the captain as if he 
were hoping for salvation from him  as he came rarely to the town 
he had not known that a blockhouse was being erected on the bridge  
therefore everything seemed to him strange and unreal as if he had 
wandered m his sleep into a strange town filled with evil and dan  
gerous men stuttering and keeping his eyes on the ground  he swore 
that he had never sung anything and that he had never struck a turk  
that he was a poor man  who looked after the water mill  that he was 
cutting wood and did not know why he had been brought here  he 
shivered from fear and was really unable to understand what had 
happened and how  after that exalted mood down there by the fresh  
ness of the stream  he had suddenly found himself bound and beaten 
here on the kapia  the centre of all interest  before so many people 
to whom he had to answer  he had himself quite forgotten that he 
had ever sung even the most innocent of songs  

but the turks stood by their words  that he had been singing in  
surrectionist songs at the moment they had been passing and that he 
had resisted them when they wanted to bind him  each of them con  
firmed this on oath to the captain who interrogated them  

 do you swear by allah   

t swear by allah   

 is that the truth   

 that is the truth   

so thrice repeated  then they put the young man beside jelisije 
and went to waken the headsman who  it seemed  slept very 
soundly  the old man looked at the youth who  confused and 
ashamed  blinked since he was not used to being the centre of 
attention in broad daylight on the bndge surrounded by so many 
people  

 what is your name   the old man asked  

   



 mile  said the youth humbly  as if he were still repl mg to the 
turkish questions 

 mile  my son  let us kiss  and the old man leant his grey head on 
mile s shoulder  let us kiss and make the sign of the cross in the 
name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in the 
name of the father and of the son and of the hoiy ghost amen   
so he crossed himself and the youth m words only  for their hands 
were bound  quickly  for the executioner had already ai rived 
the headsman  who was one of the soldiers  rapidly finished his 
task and the fiist comers  who descended the hills because of market 
day and went across the bridge  could see the two heads placed on 
fresh stakes on the blockhouse and a bloodstained place  sprinkled 
wuth gravel and smoothed down  on the bridge where they had been 
beheaded 

thus the blockhouse began its work 

from that day onwards all who were suspected or guilty of insur  
rection  whether caught on the bridge itself or somewhere on the 
frontier  were brought to the kapia once there they rarely got away 
alive  the heads of those connected with the revolt  or simply those 
who were unlucky  were exposed on stakes placed around the block  
house and their bodies thrown from the bridge into the dnna if no 
one appeared to ransom the headless corpse 
the revolt  wath shorter or longer periods of truce  lasted for 
years and m the course ot those years the number of those thrown 
into the river to drift down to  look for another  better and more 
reasonable land  was very great chance had decreed  that chance 
that overwhelms the weak and unmindful  that these two simple 
men  this pair from the mass of unlearned  poverty stricken and 
innocent  should head the procession  since it is often such men who 
are first caught up in the whirlpool of great events and whom this 
whirlpool irresistibly attracts and sucks down  thus the youth mile 
and the old man jelisije  beheaded at the same moment and in the 
same place  united as brothers  first decorated with their heads the 
military blockhouse on the kapia  which from then onwards  as long 
as the revolt lasted  was practically never without such decoration  
so these two  whom no one before then had ever seen or heard of  
remained together m memory  a memory clearer and most lasting 
than that of so many other  more important  victims  

so the kapia disappeared under this bloodstained blockhouse of ill 
repute and with it vanished also all meetings  conversations  songs 
and enjoyment  even the turks passed that way unwillingly while 
only those serbs who were forced to crossed the bridge hastily and 
with lowered heads  


   



around the wooden blockhouse  whose planks with time became 
first grey and then black  was quickly created that atmosphere that 
always surrounds buildings in permanent use by the army  the 
soldiers  washing hung from the beams and rubbish was tipped from 
the windows into the drina  dirty water and all the refuse and filth 
of barrack life on the white central pier of the bridge remained long 
dirty streaks which could be seen from afar  

the job of headsman was for long always carried out by the same 
soldier he was a fat and dark skinned anatolian with dull yellowish 
eyes and negroid lips in a greasy and earthen coloured face  who 
seemed always to be smiling  with the smile of a well nourished and 
good humoured man he was called hairuddin and was soon known 
to the whole town and even beyond the frontier  he carried out his 
duties with satisfaction and conscientiousness  and certainly he was 
exceptionally swift and skilful at them the townsmen used to say 
that he had a lighter hand than mushan the town barber  both old 
and young knew him  at least by name  and that name excited awe 
and curiosity at the same time on sunny days he would sit or lie all 
day long on the bridge in the shade under the wooden blockhouse  
from time to time he would rise to inspect the heads on the stakes  
like a market gardener his melons then he would lie down again on 
his plank in the shade  yawning and stretching himself  heavy  
rheumy eyed and good humoured  like an ageing sheepdog  at the 
end of the bridge  behind the wall  the children gathered inquisitively 
and watched him timidly  

but when his work was in question  hairuddin was alert and pre  
cise to the minutest detail  he disliked anyone to interfere with his 
work  a thing which happened more and more often as the insurrec  
tion developed when the insurgents burnt some of the villages 
above the town  the anger of the turks passed all measure  not only 
did they arrest all insurgents and spies  or those whom they con  
sidered such  and brought them to the captain on the bridge  but in 
their rancour they even wanted to take part in the execution of the 
sentence  

thus one day dawn revealed the head of the visegrad parish priest  
that same pop mihailo who had found strength to joke with the 
hodja and the rabbi on the night of the great flood  in the general 
fury against the serbs he had been killed  even though innocent  and 
the gipsy children stuck a cigar in his dead mouth  

hairuddin strongly disapproved of such actions and prevented 
them whenever he was able  

when one day the fat anatolian died unexpectedly of anthrax a 
new headsman  in truth far less skilful  continued his work and went 


   



on doing so for several years  and until the revolt in serbia had died 
down there were always two or three heads exposed on the kapia  
in such times people quickly grow hardened and insensible they 
soon became so accustomed to them that they passed them by in  
differently and paid no more heed to them  so that they did not at 
once notice when they ceased to be exhibited 

when the situation m serbia and on the frontier died down  the 
blockhouse lost its importance and its reason for existence but the 
guard went on sleeping there  although the crossing of the bridge 
had long been free and without supervision in every army things 
change slowly and in the turkish army more slowly than in any 
other  and so it would have remained for god alone knows how 
long had not a fire broken out one night because of a forgotten 
candle the blockhouse was made of resinous planks and was still 
warm after the heat of the day it burnt to its foundations  that is to 
say down to the flagstones of the kapia  

the excited people of the town watched the huge blaze which lit 
up not only the bridge but also the mountains around  and was re  
flected m wavering red light on the surface of the river  when morn  
ing broke  the bridge again appeared in its former shape freed from 
the clumsy wooden monstrosity which had for years concealed its 
kapia  the white stones were tarnished and sooty  but the rains and 
snows soon washed them clean again thus nothing remained of the 
blockhouse and the bloody events connected with it save a few bitter 
memories which paled and finally disappeared with that generation  
and one oak beam which had not been burnt as it was fixed into the 
stone steps of the kapia 

so the kapia once again became for the town what it had formerly 
been  on the left terrace as one came from the town a coffee brewer 
once again lit his brazier and set out his utensils  only the fountain 
had suffered  for the snake s head from which the water had flowed 
had been crushed  the people once again began to dally on the sola 
and pass the time there in conversation  in business deals or in 
drowsy time wasting  on summer nights the young men sang there 
in groups or sat there solitary suppressing their love yearning or 
giving way to that vague desire to go out into the distant world to do 
great deeds and take part in great events which so often torments 
young people brought up in a narrow milieu  after a score or so of 
years a new generation grew up which did not even remember the 
deformed wooden carcass of the blockhouse or the harsh cries of the 
guard stopping travellers by night  or hairuddin or the exposed heads 
which he had cut off with such professional skill  only some of the 
old women  driving away the urchins who came to steal their 


   



peaches  would shout m loud and angry curses  

 may god send hairuddm to cut your hair for you  may your 
mother recognize your head on the kapiav 
but the children who ran away over the fences could not under  
stand the real sense of these curses  though they knew  naturally  
that they meant nothing favourable  

thus the generations renewed themselves beside the bridge and 
the bridge shook from itself  like dust  all the traces which transient 
human events had left on it and remained  when all was over  un  
changed and unchangeable 


   



vii 




t ime passed over the bridge by years and decades those 
were the few decades about the middle of the nineteenth 
century in which the turkish empire was consumed by a 
slow fever measured by the eye of a contemporary  those 
years seemed comparatively peaceful and serene  although they had 
their shaie of anxieties and fears and knew droughts and floods and 
epidemics and all manner of exciting events  only all these things 
came m their own time  in short spasms amid long lulls  

the border between the two pashaluks of bosnia and belgrade  
which passed just above the town  began in those years to become 
ever more sharply defined and to take on the appearance and signifi  
cance of a state frontier that changed the conditions of life for the 
whole district and for the town also  influenced trade and communi  
cations  and the mutual relations of turks and serbs 
the older turks frowned and blinked in incredulity  as if they 
wished to drive away this unpleasant apparition they threatened 
and discussed and then for months at a time forgot all about the 
matter  until harsh reality would once again remind them and alarm 
them once more  

thus  one spring day one of the turks from veletovo  up there on 
the frontier  sat on the kapia and with deep emotion told the leading 
turks gathered there what had been happening at veletovo 
some time in the winter  the man from veletovo said  there had 
appeared above their village the ill famed jovan mi ic  the serdar of 
ruyan  who had come from arilje with armed men and begun to 
inspect and mark out the frontier  when they asked him what he 
intended to do and why he was there  he replied arrogantly that he 
had to give account to no one  least of all to bosnian renegades  but 
if they really wanted to know he had been sent there by the 
prince milos to find out where the frontier was to run and how much 
was to be included in serbia  

 we thought   said the man from veletovo   that the vlach was 
drunk and did not know what he was saying  for we have long known 


   



him as a bandit and a rascal so we refused to let him stay and then 
forgot all about him  but not more than two months later he came 
again  this time with a whole company of milos  soldiers and a dele  
gate of the sultan  a soft pale fellow from stambul we could not 
believe our eyes but the delegate confirmed everything he lowered 
his eyes in shame  but he confirmed  thus  he said  it had been 
ordered by imperial decree that milos should administer serbia in 
the sultan s name and that the frontier should be marked out  to 
know exactly to what point his authority stretched when the dele  
gate s men began to drive in stakes along the crest below tetrebica  
micic came and pulled them up and threw them aside the mad 
vlach  may the dogs eat his flesh   flew at the delegate  shouted at 
him as if he were a subordinate and threatened him with death 
that  he said  was not the frontier  the frontier had been fixed by the 
sultan and the russian tsar who had given a ferman to prince milos 
it now ran along the lim down as far as the visegrad bridge and 
thence down the drina  thus all this land is part of seibia this too  
he said  is only for a certain time  later it will have to be advanced 
the delegate had great trouble m convincing him and then they fixed 
the frontier above veletovo and there it remains  at least for the 
present only from then on we have been filled with doubt and a 
sort of fear  so that we do not know what to do or where to turn 
we have discussed all this with the people of uzice  but they too do 
not know what has happened nor what to expect and old hadji  
zuko who has twice been to mecca and is now more than ninety 
years old says that before a generation has passed the turkish fron  
tier will be withdrawn right to the black sea  fifteen days  march 
away   

the leading turks of visegrad listened to the man from veletovo  
they seemed calm to all outward appearance  but inwardly they 
were shaken and confused  they squirmed unintentionally at his 
words and caught hold of the stone seat with their hands  as if some 
powerful and invisible force were shaking the bridge beneath them  
then  mastering themselves  they sought words to lessen and 
diminish the importance of this event  

they did not like unfavourable news or heavy thoughts or serious 
and despondent conversations on the kapia  but they could see for 
themselves that this boded no good  nor could they deny what the 
man from veletovo had said or find words to calm and reassure him 
so they could scarcely wait for the peasant who had brought this 
unpleasant news to return to his village in the mountains  that  
naturally  would not lessen the anxiety but it would remove it far 
from them  and when in fact the man went away  they were only 


   



too pleased to be able to return to their usual habits  and to go on 
sitting peacefully on the kapia without conversations which made 
life disagreeable and the future teinfying  and to leave it to time to 
soften and ease the weight of the events which had taken place over 
there behind the mountains 

time did its work life went on  to all appearances unchanged 
more than thirty years passed since that conversation on the kapia  
but those stakes which the sultan s delegate and the serdar of ruyan 
had planted struck root and brought forth fruit  late ripening but 
bitter to the turks the turks had now to abandon even the last 
towns m serbia one summer day the bridge at visegrad was bur  
dened with a pitiable procession of refugees from uzice 

it was on one of those hot days with long pleasant twilights on the 
kapia when the turks from the market place filled both the terraces 
over the water on such days melons were brought there on donkey 
back the ripe canteloupes and water melons had been cooled all day 
long and in the early evening people would buy and eat them on the 
soia  usually two of them would bet whether the inside of a certain 
water melon were red or white then they would cut it open and 
whoever lost paid for it and they would eat it together  with talk and 
loud jokes  

the day s warmth still beat up from the stone terraces but with 
the twilight there was a cool refreshing air from the water the 
middle of the river shone  and near the banks under the willows it 
turned a shadowy dull green all the hills around were reddened by 
the sunset  some strongly and others scarcely touched above them  
filling the whole south western part of that amphitheatre which 
could be seen from the kapia were summer mists of continually 
changing colour these mists are among the most beautiful sights to 
be seen in summer on the kapia as soon as the daylight grows strong 
and the sun leaps up  they appear behind the mountains like thick 
white silvery grey masses  creating fantastic landscapes  irregular 
cupolas and countless strange buildings  they remain thus all day 
long  heavy and unmoving above the hills surrounding the town 
which swelters in the sun  the turks who in early evening sat on the 
kapia had those mists always before their eyes like white silken 
imperial tents which in their imagination evoked vague shapes of 
wars and forays and pictures of strange and immeasurable power 
and luxury  till darkness extinguished and dispersed them and the 
skies created fresh magic from the stars and moonlight  

never could the wonderful and exceptional beauty of the kapia 
be better felt than at that hour on such summer days  a man was 
then as if in a magic swing  he swung over the earth and the waters 

   



and flew in the skies  yet was firmly and surely linked with the town 
and his own white house there on the bank with its plum orchard 
about it  with the solace of coffee and tobacco  many of those 
simple citizens  who owned little more than those houses and the 
few shops in the market place  felt at such times the richness of the 
world and the illimitability of god s gifts such a bridge  lovely and 
strong  could offer all this to men and would continue to offer it for 
centuries to come  

this was just such an evening  an evening filled with chatter and 
laughter and  okes among themselves and the passers by 

the spnghthest and loudest jokes centred on a short but powerful 
young man of strange appearance  this was salko corkan  one eyed 
salko 

salko was the son of a gipsy woman and some anatolian soldier or 
officer who had at some time been stationed in the town and had 
left it before this unwanted son had been born  shortly afterwards  
his mother too had died and the child had grown up without anyone 
of his own  the whole town fed him  he belonged to everybody and 
nobody he did odd jobs about the shops and houses  carried out 
tasks which no one else would do  cleaned the cesspools and street 
channels  and buried anything that had died or had been brought 
down by the waters he had never had a house or occupation of his 
own he ate whatever he happened to find  still standing or walking 
about  slept in attics  and dressed in parti coloured rags given him by 
others  while still a child he had lost his left eye  eccentric  good  
humoured  merry and a drunkard  he often worked for the towns  
men for a word or a joke instead of pay  

around salko had gathered a number of merchants  sons  young 
men who laughed at him and played crude jokes on him  

the air smelt of fresh melons and roasting coffee  from the great 
flagstones  still warm from the day s heat  and sprinkled with water  
rose moist and scented the special smell of the kapia which filled 
men with freedom from care and evoked lively fancies  

it was the moment between day and night  the sun had set but the 
great star which rose over moljevnik had not yet appeared  in such 
a moment  when even the most ordinary thing took on the appear  
ance of a vision filled with majesty  terror and special meaning  the 
first refugees from uiice appeared on the bridge  

the men were for the most part on foot  dusty and bowed  while 
the women wrapped in their veils were balanced on small horses 
with small children tied to the saddle bags or to boxes  now and 
again a more important man rode a better horse  but with lowered 
head and at a funereal pace  revealing even more clearly the misfor  

d    



tune which had driven them hither some of them were leading a 
single goat on a short halter  others carried lambs m their laps  all 
were silent  even the children did not cry  all that could be heard was 
the beat of horseshoes and footsteps and the monotonous chinking 
of wooden and copper vessels on the overloaded horses 

the appearance of this overtired and destitute procession 
dampened the gaiety on the kapia  the older people remained seated 
on the stone benches  while the younger stood up and formed living 
walls on both sides of the kapia and the procession passed between 
them some of the townsmen only looked compassionately at the 
refugees and remained silent  while others greeted them with 
 merhaba  tried to stop them and offer them something they paid 
no attention to the offers and scarcely responded to the greetings  
but hurried on to reach their post for the night at okoliste while it 
was still light  

in all there were about i o families more than loo families were 
going on to sarajevo where there was a chance of being settled  while 
fifteen were to stay in the town  they were for the most part those 
who had relatives there  

one only of these dog tired men  poor m appearance and appar  
ently alone  stopped for a moment on the kapia  drank his fill of 
water and accepted an offered cigar  he was white all over from the 
dust of the road  his eyes shone as if in fever and he was unable to 
keep his glance fixed on any single object  vigorously puffing out 
smoke  he looked around him with those shining disagreeable 
glances  without replying to the timid and humble questions of indi  
viduals  he only wiped his long moustaches  thanked them curtly 
and with that bitterness which overtiredness and a feeling of being 
outcast leaves in a man he muttered a few words looking at them 
with one of those sudden unseeing glances  

 you sit here at your ease and do not know what is happening be  
hind stanisevac  here we are fleeing into turkish lands  but where 
are you to flee when  together with us  your turn will come  none 
of you knows and none of you ever thinks of it   

he suddenly ceased  even the little he said was much for those who 
till then had been so carefree  and yet little enough for his own bitter  
ness which would not allow him to stay silent yet at the same time 
prevented him from expressing himself clearly it was he himself 
who cut short the heavy silence by saying farewell and hurrying 
away to catch up with the rest of the procession  all stood up to 
shout good wishes after him  

all that evening the mood on the kapia remained heavy  all were 
silent and downcast even salko sat dumb and motionless on one of 


   



the stone steps surrounded by the husks of the water melons he had 
eaten for a bet  depressed and silent he sat there with downcast 
looks  absent mindedly  as though he were not looking at the stone 
before him but at something far distant which he could scarcely 
perceive  the people began to disperse earlier than usual 

but next day everything was as it had always been  for the towns  
men did not like to remember evil and did not worry about the 
future  in their blood was the conviction that real life consists of 
calm periods and that it would be mad and vain to spoil them by 
looking for some other  firmer and more lasting life that did not 
exist  

in those twenty five years in the middle of the nineteenth century 
the plague raged twice at sarajevo and the cholera once  when this 
happened the town kept regulations which  according to tradition  
had been given by mohammed himself to the faithful for their 
guidance in the event of an epidemic   while the pestilence rages m 
some place do not go there  for you may become infected  and if you 
are already in the place where it rages then do not depart from that 
place lest you infect others   but since men do not observe even the 
most salutory of regulations  even when they derive from the 
apostle of god himself  if not forced to do so by  the power of the 
authorities   then the authorities on the occasion of every  plague  
limited or completely stopped all travel and postal communications  
then life on the kapia changed its aspect the people of the town  
busy or at leisure  thoughtful or singing  disappeared  and on the 
empty sofa  as in times of war or revolution  once again sat a guard 
of several gendarmes  they stopped all travellers coming from the 
direction of sarajevo and waved them back with their rifles or 
shouted loudly to them to retreat  the post they accepted from the 
messenger but with every measure of precaution  a small fire of 
 aromatic woods  was lit on the kapia and produced an abundant 
white smoke  the gendarmes took each individual letter in a pair 
of tongs and passed it through this smoke  only such  purified  
letters were sent onward goods they did not accept at all  but their 
mam task was not with letters but with living men  every day a few 
arrived  travellers  merchants  bearers of news  tramps  a gendarme 
awaited them at the entry to the bridge and from a distance signalled 
with his hand that they might not go farther  the traveller would 
halt  but begin to argue  to justify himself and explain his case each 
of them considered that it was absolutely necessary to let him into 
the town and each of them swore that he was healthy and had had 
no connection with the cholera which was there somewhere in 
sarajevo  during these explanations the travellers would edge little 


   



by little halfway across the bridge and approach the kapia there  
other gendarmes would take their part in the conversation and as 
they talked at several paces distance they all shouted loudly and 
waved their arms those gendarmes also joined in who sat all day 
on the kapia sipping plum brandy and eating garlic  their service gave 
them this right for it was believed that both these were good anti  
dotes against infection  and they made abundant use of their 
privilege  

many a traveller would grow tired of pleading with and trying to 
convince the gendarmes and would return downcast  his work un  
finished  along the okoliste road but some were more persistent and 
persevering and remained there on the kapia hoping for a moment 
of weakness or inattention or some mad and lucky chance if it so 
happened that the leader of the town gendarmes  salko hedo  were 
there  then there was no likelihood that the traveller would achieve 
anything hedo was that true conscientious official who does not 
really see or hear whomever he talks to  and who only considers him 
in so far as it is necessary to find the place for him set out by the 
regulations in force until he had done this he was deaf and blind and 
when he had done it he become dumb as well  in vain the traveller 
would implore or flatter  

 salik aga  i am healthy   

 well then  go in health whence you came get along  out of my 
sight       

there was no arguing with hedo but if some of the younger 
gendarmes were alone  then something might still be done  the 
longer the traveller stood on the bridge and the more he shouted and 
talked with them  told all his troubles  why he had set out and all 
the problems of his life  the more personal and familiar he seemed 
to become and less and less like a man who might have cholera in 
the end  one of the gendarmes would offer to take a message for him 
to whomever he wished in the town this was the first step towards 
yielding  but the traveller knew that the message would never be 
delivered for the gendarmes  always suffering from a hangover or 
half drunk as they were  remembered things with difficulty and de  
livered messages inside out  therefore he went on indefinitely with 
i his conversation  implored  offered bnbes  called upon god and his 
 soul all this he did until the gendarme whom he had marked down 
as the most lenient remained alone on the bndge  then the business 
was finished somehow or other  the soulful gendarme would turn 
his face to the raised wall as if to read the ancient inscription on it  
with his hands behind his back and the palm of his right hand ex  
tended  the persevenng traveller would put the agreed sum of 



money into the gendarme s palm  glance right and left  and then 
slide across the other half of the bridge and become lost in the town 
the gendarme went back to his post  chewed a head of garlic and 
washed it down with plum brandy this filled him with a certain 
gay and carefree resolution and gave him fresh strength to keep vigil 
and guard the town from cholera  

but misfortunes do not last forever  this they have in common 
with  oys  but pass away or are at least diminished and become lost 
in oblivion life on the kapia always renews itself despite everything 
and the bridge does not change with the years or with the centuries 
or with the most painful turns m human affairs  all these pass over it  
even as the unquiet waters pass beneath its smooth and perfect 
arches

i t was not only the wars  pestilences and migrations of the times 
which broke against the bridge and interrupted life on the kapia  
there were also other exceptional events which gave their name 
to the year in which they took place and were long remembered 

left and right of the kapia in both directions  the stone parapet of 
the bridge had long become smooth and somewhat darker than the 
rest  for hundreds of years the peasants had rested their burdens on 
it when crossing the bridge  or idlers had leant shoulders and elbows 
upon it in conversation while waiting for others or when  solitary 
and leaning on their elbows  they looked in the depths below them 
at the waters as they went foaming swiftly past  always new and yet 
always the same  

but never had so many idle and inquisitive people leant on the 
parapet and watched the surface of the water  as if to read in it the 
answer to some riddle  as in the last days of august that year  the 
water was clouded by the rains though it was only towards the end 
of summer  in the eddies below the arches a white foam formed  
which moved in circles with twigs  small branches and rubbish  but 
the leisurely and leaning townsmen were not really looking at the 
waters which they had always known and which had nothing to tell 
them  but on the surface of the water and in their own conversations 
they searched for some sort of explanation for themselves and tried 
to find there some visible trace of an obscure and cruel destiny 
which  in those days  had troubled and surprised them  

about that time an unusual thing had taken place on the kapia 
which would long be remembered and which was not likely to hap  
pen again as long as the bridge and the town on the drina existed  it 
had excited and shaken the townspeople and the story of it had 
passed beyond the town itself  to other places and districts  to be  
come a legend  

this was  in fact  a tale of two v egrad hamlets  velje lug and 
nezuke  these two hamlets lay at the extreme ends of that amphi  


    



theatre formed about the town by the dark mountains and their 
green foothills  

the great village of strazi te on the north eastern side of the valley 
was the nearest to the town its houses  fields and gardens were scat  
tered over several foothills and embowered in the valleys between 
them on the rounded flank of one of these hills lay about fifteen 
houses  buried in plum orchards and surrounded on all sides by 
fields  this was the hamlet of velje lug  a peaceful  rich and beauti  
ful turkish settlement on the slopes  the hamlet belonged to the vil  
lage of straziste  but it was nearer to the town than to its own village 
centre  for the men of velje lug could walk down to the market  
place m half an hour  had their shops there and did business in the 
town like the ordinary townsmen  between them and the townsmen 
there was indeed little or no difference save perhaps that their pro  
perties were more solid and lasting for they stood on the firm earth  
not subject to floods  and the men there were more modest and did 
not have the bad habits of the town  velje lug had good soil  pure 
water and handsome people  

a branch of the visegrad family of osmanagic lived there  but 
even though those in the town were richer and more numerous  it 
was generally considered that they had  degenerated  and that the 
real osmanagids were those of velje lug whence the family had 
come they were a fine race of men  sensitive and proud of their 
origin their house  the largest in the district  showing up white on 
the hillside just below the crest of the hill  turned towards the south  
west  it was always freshly whitewashed  with a roof of blackened 
thatch and fifteen glazed windows  their house could be seen from 
afar and was the first to catch the eye of a traveller coming to vise  
grad and the last that he saw on leaving it  the last rays of the setting 
sun behind the lijestan ridge rested there and shone on the white 
and shining face of this house the townsmen were long accustomed 
to look at it from the kapia in the early evening and see how the 
setting sun was reflected from the osmanagid windows and how the 
light left them one after the other  as the sun set and the town was 
in shadow its last rays  falling on one of the windows  as it broke 
through the clouds  would shine for a few moments longer like a 
huge red star over the darkened town  

also well known and esteemed in the town was the head of that 
house  avdaga osmanagid  a bold and fiery man in private life as in 
business  he had a shop in the market  a low twilit room in which 
maize  dried plums or pinecones lay scattered over planks and 
plaited mats avdaga only did a wholesale trade  therefore his shop 
was not open every day  but regularly on market days and through  


    



out the week according to the needs of business in it was always 
one of avdaga s sons  while he himself usually sat on a bench before 
it  there he chatted with customers or acquaintances  he was a big 
and imposing man  ruddy in appearance  but with pure white beard 
and moustaches his voice was harsh and throaty for years he had 
suffered cruelly from asthma whenever he grew excited m conver  
sation and raised his voice  and that was a frequent occurrence  he 
would suddenly choke  his neck tendons stand out  his face grow 
red and his eyes fill with tears  while his chest creaked  wheezed and 
echoed like a storm on the hills when the fit of choking had passed  
he would pull himself together  take a deep breath and go on with 
the conversation where he had left off  only in a changed thin voice 
he was known in the town and the surroundings as a man of harsh 
words  but generous and brave  so he was in everything  even in 
business  though often to his own hurt  often by a bold word he 
would reduce or raise the price of plums or maize even when this 
was not to his own advantage  only to spite some avaricious peasant 
or rapacious merchant  his word was universally listened to and 
accepted in the market place  though it was known that he was often 
hasty and personal in his judgments when avdaga came down from 
velje lug and sat before his shop he was rarely alone  for men liked 
to listen to his talk and wanted to hear his opinion  he was always 
open and lively  ready to speak out and defend what others con  
sidered was best passed over in silence his asthma and attacks of 
heavy coughing would interrupt his conversation at any moment  
but for a wonder this did not spoil it but made it seem the more con  
vincing and his whole manner of expressing himself had a sort of 
heavy and painful dignity  which it was not easy to resist  

avdaga had five married sons and an only daughter  who was the 
youngest of his children and just ripe for marriage  she was called 
fata and it was known of her that she was exceptionally beautiful 
and the very image of her father  the whole town and to some extent 
even the whole district discussed the question of her marriage  it has 
always been the case with us that at least one girl in every generation 
passes into legend and song because of her beauty  her qualities and 
her nobility  so she was in those few years the goal of all desires and 
  the inaccessible example  imagination flared up at mention of her 
name and she was surrounded by the enthusiasm of the men and the 
envy of the women  she was one of those outstanding persons set 
apart by nature and raised to dangerous heights  

this daughter of avdaga resembled her father not only in face and 
appearance but also in quickness of wit and the gift of words  the 
youths who  at weddings or meetings  sought to win her by cheap 


    



flattery or embarrass her by daring jests  knew this well  her wit was 
no less than her beauty therefore  in the song about fata the daugh  
ter of avdaga  songs about such exceptional beings spring up of 
themselves spontaneously  it was sung 

thou art wise as thou art lovely  

lovely fata avdagma 

so they sang and spoke in the town  but there were very few who 
had the courage to ask for the hand of the girl from velje lug  and 
when they had one and all been rejected  a sort of vacuum was 
created about fata  an enchanted circle  made of hatred and envy  
of unacknowledged desires and of malicious expectation  such a 
circle as always surrounds beings with exceptional gifts and an ex  
ceptional destiny  such persons  of whom much is said and sung  are 
rapidly borne away by that especial destiny of theirs and leave be  
hind them  instead of a life fulfilled  a song or a story  

thus it often happens amongst us that a girl who is much spoken 
of remains for that very reason without suitors and  sits out   where  
as girls who in no way measure up to her marry quickly and easily  
this was not destined for fata  for a suitor was found who had the 
audacity to desire her and the skill and endurance to attain his ends 

in that irregular circle formed by the visegrad valley  exactly on 
the opposite side from velje lug  lay the hamlet of nezuke  

above the bridge  not quite an hour s walk upstream  amid that 
circle of dark mountains whence  as from a wall  the drina breaks 
out in a sudden curve  there was a narrow strip of good and fertile 
land on the stony river bank  this was formed by the deposits 
brought down by the river and by the torrents which came down 
from the precipitous slopes of the butkovo rocks  on it were fields 
and gardens and  above them  steep meadows with sparse grass 
which lost themselves on the slopes in rugged stone crops and dark 
undergrowth  the whole hamlet was the property of the hamzid 
family  who were also known by the name of turkovii  on one half 
lived five or six families of serfs and on the other were the houses 
of the hamzid brothers  with mustajbeg hamzid at their head  the 
hamlet was remote and exposed  without sun but also without wind  
richer in fruit and hay than in wheat  surrounded and shut in on all 
sides by steep hills  the greater part of the day it was in shadow and 
in silence  so that every call of the shepherds and every movement 
of the cowbells was heard as a loud and repeated echo from the hills  
one path only led to it from visegrad  when one crossed the bridge 
coming from the town and left the main road which turned to the 



right down river  one came upon a narrow stone track to the left 
across a patch of waste and stony ground up the dnna along the 
water s edge  like a white selvedge on the dark slopes which ran 
down to the river a man on horse or on foot going along that path  
when seen from the bridge above  seemed as if he were going along a 
narrow tree trunk between the water and the stone  and his reflection 
could be seen following him in the calm green waters 
that was the path which led from the tow n to nezuke  and from 
nezuke there was no w ay on  for there was nowhere to go  above 
the houses  in the steep slopes overgrown with sparse forest  two 
deep white w atercourses had been cut  up which the shepherds 
climbed when they took the cattle to their mountain pastures  

there was the great w hite house of the eldest hamzid  mustajbeg 
it was in no way smaller than the osmanagid house at velje lug  but 
it was different in that it was completely invisible in that hollow 
alongside the drina around it grew fifteen tall poplars in a semi  
circle  whose murmur and movement gave life to that spot so shut 
in and difficult of access  below this house were the smaller and 
humbler houses of the remaining pair of hamzid brothers all the 
hamzids had many children and all were fair skinned  tall and 
slender  taciturn and reserved  but well able to hold their own in 
business  united and active in all their affairs like all the richer 
people at velje lug  they too had their shops in the town where they 
brought for sale everything that they produced at nezuke  at all 
times of the year  they and their serfs swarmed and climbed like 
ants along that narrow stony track beside the dnna bringing pro  
duce to the town or returning  their business concluded  with money 
in their pockets  to their invisible village among the hills 
mustajbeg hamzid s great white house awaited the visitor as a 
pleasant surprise at the end of that stony track that seemed as if it 
led nowhere mustajbeg had four daughters and one son  nail this 
nail beg of nezuke  only son of a noble family  was among the first 
to cast an eye on fata of velje lug  he had admired her beauty at 
some wedding or other through a half opened door  outside which a 
group of young men had been hanging like a bunch of grapes  when 
he next had the chance of seeing her  surrounded by a group of her 
friends  he had essayed a daring jest  

 may god and mustajbeg give you the name of young bride   

fata gave a stifled giggle  

 do not laugh   said the excited youth through the narrow open  
ing of the door   even that marvel will take place one day   

 it will indeed  when velje lug comes down to nezuke   replied 
the girl with another laugh and a proud movement of her body  such 

io  



as only women like her and of her age can make  and which said 
more than her words and her laugh  

it is thus that those beings especially gifted by nature often pro  
voke their destiny  boldly and thoughtlessly  her reply to young 
hamzid was repeated from mouth to mouth  as was everything else 
that she said or did 

but the hamzids were not men to be put off or discouraged at the 
first difficulty even when it was a question of minor matters  they 
did not come to a conclusion hastily so how much less in such a 
question as this  an attempt made through some relations in the 
town had no better success  but then old mustajbeg hamzid took 
into his own hands the matter of his son s marriage  he had always 
had common business dealings with osmanagid avdaga had recently 
had some serious losses  due to his explosive and proud character  
and mustajbeg had helped him and supported him as only good mer  
chants can help and support one another in difficult moments  
simply  naturally and without unnecessary words  

in these cool half lit shops and on the smooth stone benches be  
fore them were settled not only matters of commercial honour but 
also human destinies what happened there between avdaga 
osmanagid and mustajbeg hamzid  how did mustajbeg come to ask 
for the hand of fata for his only son nail  and why did the proud and 
upright avdaga  give  the girl  no one will ever know  no one will 
ever know either exactly how the matter was thrashed out up there 
at velje lug between the father and his lovely only daughter  there 
could  naturally  be no question of any opposition on her part  one 
look filled with pained surprise and that proud and inborn movement 
of her whole body  and then mute submission to her father s wishes  
as it was and still is everywhere and always amongst us  as if in a 
dream  she began to air  to complete and to arrange her trousseau  

nor did a single word from nezuke filter out to the outer world 
the prudent hamzids did not ask other men to confirm their suc  
cesses in empty words  they had achieved their wish and  as always  
were content with their success there was no need of anyone else 
to share in their satisfaction  even as they had never asked for sym  
pathy in their failures and their misfortunes 

but none the less people talked of this widely and unthinkingly  
as is the habit of men  it was told throughout the town and the 
country around that the hamzife had got what they wanted  and 
that the lovely  proud and clever daughter of avdaga  for whom no 
suitor good enough had been found in all bosnia  had been outplayed 
and tamed  that none the less  velje lug would come to nezuke  even 
though fata had publicly proclaimed that it would not for people 


    



love to talk about the downfall and humiliation of those who have 
been exalted too much or have flown too high  

for a month the people savoured the event and drank in tales of 
fata s humiliation like sweet water  for a month they made prepara  
tions at nezuke and at velje lug  

for a month fata worked with her fnends  her relations and her 
servants on her trousseau the girls sang  she too sang  she even 
found strength to do that  and she heard herself singing  though she 
still thought her own thoughts for with every stroke of her needle 
she told herself that neither she nor her needlework would ever see 
nezuke she never forgot this for an instant only  thus working and 
thus singing  it seemed to her that it was a long way from velje lug 
to nezuke and that a month was a long time at night it was the 
same at night when  with the excuse that she had some work to 
finish  she remained alone there opened before her a world rich and 
full of light  of joyful and unlimited change 

at velje lug the nights were warm and fresh the stars seemed 
low  and dancing  as though bound together by a white shimmering 
radiance standing before her window  fata looked out at the night  
through all her body she felt a calm strength  overflowing and 
sweet  and every part of her body seemed a special source of strength 
and joy  her legs  her hips  her arms  her neck and above all her 
breasts  her breasts  full and large but firm  touched the frame of the 
window with their nipples and in that place she felt the whole hill  
side with all that was on it  houses  outbuildings  fields  breathing 
warmly  deeply  rising and falling with the shining heavens and the 
expanse of the night with that breathing the wooden frame of the 
window rose and fell  touching the tips of her breasts  leaving them 
once more for some vast distance and then returning once again to 
touch them  then rising and falling again and again  

yes  the world was great  the world was limitless even by day 
when the valley of vi egrad quivered in the heat and one could al  
most hear the wheat ripening and when the white town was strung 
out along the green river  framed by the straight lines of the bridge 
and the dark mountains but at night  only at night  the skies grew 
alive and burst open into infinity and the power of that world where 
a living being is lost  and has no longer the sense of what he is  where 
he is going or what he wishes or what he must do  only there one 
lived truly  serenely and for long  in that space there were no longer 
words that bound one tragically for one s whole life  no longer fate  
ful promises or situations from which one could not escape  with the 
brief time that flows and flows onward inexorably  with death or 
shame as the only outcome  yes  in that space it was not as it is in 

io  



everyday life  where what has once been said remains irrevocable 
and what has been promised inescapable  there everything was free  
endless  nameless and mute  

then  from somewhere below her  as from afar  could be heard a 
heavy  deep and stifled sound  

a a a aah  kkkh       a a a aaah       kkkkh   

down on the ground floor avdaga was struggling with his nightly 
attack of coughing  

she heard the sound and could see her father clearly  almost as if 
he were there before her  as he sat and smoked  sleepless and tor  
mented by his cough  she could see his big brown eyes  as well known 
as a dear landscape  eyes which were just like her own  save that they 
were shadowed by old age and bathed in a tearful yet laughing 
shimmer  eyes in which for the first time she had seen the inevitabi  
lity of her fate on that day she was told that she had been promised 
to hamzid and that she must finish her preparations within a month  

 kkha  kkha  kkha  aaaaah   

that ecstasy of a moment before at the beauty of the night and the 
greatness of the world was suddenly extinguished that perfumed 
breath of the earth ceased  the girl s breasts tightened in a brief 
spasm  the stars and the expanse disappeared  only fate  her cruel 
and irrevocable fate on the eve of its realization was being completed 
and accomplished as the time passed in the stillness of that immobi  
lity and that void which remained beyond the world 

the sound of coughing echoed from the floor below 

yes  she both saw and heard him as if he were standing beside her  
that was her own dear  powerful  only father with whom she had 
felt herself to be one  indivisibly and sweetly  ever since she had been 
conscious of her own existence  she felt that heavy shattering cough 
as if it had been in her own breast  in truth it had been that mouth 
that had said yes where her own had said no  but she was at one with 
him in everything  even in this  that yes of his she felt as if it were 
her own  even as she felt too her own no   therefore her fate was 
cruel  unusual  immediate  and therefore she saw no escape from 
it and could see none  for none existed  but one thing she knew  
because of her father s yes  which bound her as much as her own 
no  she would have to appear before the kadi with mustajbeg s son  
for it was inconceivable to think that avdaga osmanagid did not 
keep his word  but she knew too  equally well  that after the cere  
mony her feet would never take her to nezuke  for that would mean 
that she had not kept her own word  that too was inconceivable  for 
that too was the word of an osmanagid  there  on that point of no 
return  between her no and her father s yes  between velje lug and 


    



nezuke  somewhere in that most inescapable impasse  she must find 
a way out that was all she thought of now no longer the expanses 
of the great rich world  not even the whole route from velje lug to 
nezuke  but only that short and pitiful little scrap of road which led 
from the courthouse m which the kadi would marry her to mustaj  
beg s son  as far as the end of the bridge where the stony slope led 
down to the narrow track which led to nezuke and on which  she 
knew for a certainty  she would never set foot her thoughts flew 
incessantly up and down that little scrap of road  from one end to 
the other  like a shuttle through the weave they would fly from the 
courthouse  across the market place to the end of the bridge  to halt 
there as before an impassable abyss  and then back across the bridge  
across the market place to the courthouse always thus  back and 
forward  forward and back  there her destiny was woven 

and those thoughts which could neither remain still nor were 
able to find a way out  more and more often halted at the kapia  on 
that lovely and shining sofa  where the townspeople sat in conversa  
tion and the young men sang  and beneath which roared the deep 
swift green waters of the river then  horrified at such a way of 
escape  they would fly once again  as if under a curse  from one end 
of the journey to the other and  without finding any other solution  
would stop there once again on the kapia every night her thoughts 
more and more often halted there and remained there longer  the 
very thought of that day  when in fact and not only in her thoughts 
she must go along that way and find her way out before she reached 
the end of the bridge  brought with it all the terror of death or the 
horror of a life of shame  it seemed to her  helpless and forsaken  
that the very terror of that thought must remove or at least postpone 
that day  

but the days passed  neither fast nor slow  but regular and fateful 
and with them came at last the day of the wedding  

on that last thursday in august  that was the fateful day  the 
hamzids came on horseback for the girl  covered with a heavy new 
black veil  as if under a suit of armour  fata was seated on a horse 
and led into the town  meanwhile  in the courtyard  horses were 
loaded with the chests containing her trousseau  the marriage was 
announced in the courthouse before the kadi  so was kept the word 
by which avdaga gave his daughter to mustajbeg s son  then the 
little procession set out on the way to nezuke where the formal 
wedding ceremonies had been prepared  

they passed through the market place  a part of that road without 
escape which fata had covered so often in her thoughts  it was firm  
real and everyday  almost easier to traverse than in her imagination  


    



no stars  no expanse  no father s muffled cough  no desire for time 
to go more quickly or more slowly  when they reached the bridge  
the girl felt once more  as in the summer nights before her window  
every part of her body strongly and separately  and especially her 
breasts in a light constriction as if in a corselet  the party arrived on 
the kapia  as she had done so many times in her thoughts those 
last nights  the girl leant over and in a whisper begged the youngest 
brother who was riding beside her to shorten her stirrups a little  for 
they were coming to that steep passage from the bridge down to the 
stony track which led to nezuke  they stopped  first those two and 
then  a little farther on  the other wedding guests  there was nothing 
unusual in this it was not the first nor would it be the last time that 
a wedding procession halted on the kapia  while the brother dis  
mounted  went around the horse and threw the reins over his arm  
the girl urged her horse to the very edge of the bridge  put her right 
foot on the stone parapet  sprang from the saddle as if she had wings  
leapt over the parapet and threw herself into the roaring river below 
the bridge  the brother rushed after her and threw himself at full 
length on the parapet  managing to touch with his hand the flying 
veil but was unable to hold it the rest of the wedding guests leapt 
from their horses with the most extraordinary cries and remained 
along the stone parapet in strange attitudes as if they too had been 
turned to stone  

that same day rain fell before evening  abundant and exception  
ally cold for the time of year  the drina rose and grew angry  next 
day theyellowish flood waters threw fata s corpse on to a shoal near 
kalata  there it was seen by a fisherman who went at once to notify 
the police chief  a little later the police chief himself arrived with 
the muktar  the fisherman and salko corkan for without salko 
nothing of this sort could ever take place  

the corpse was lying in soft wet sand  the waves moved it to and 
fro and from time to time their cloudy waters washed over it  the 
new black veil which the waters had not succeeded in pulling off had 
been turned back and thrown over her head  mingled with her long 
thick hair it formed a strange black mass beside the white lovely 
body of the young girl from which the current had tom away the 
thin wedding garments frowning and with set jaws salko and the 
fisherman waded out to the shoal  caught hold of the naked girl and  
embarrassed and carefully  as if she were still alive  took her to the 
bank from the wet sand in which she had already begun to sink  and 
there at once covered her with the wet and mud bespattered veil  

that same day the drowned girl was buried in the nearest moslem 
graveyard  on the steep slope below the hill on which velje lug was 


lit 



built  and before evening the ne er do wells of the town had collected 
m the inn around salko and the fisherman with that unhealthy and 
prurient curiosity which is especially developed among those whose 
life is empty  deprived of every beauty and lacking in excitement 
and events  they toasted them in plum brandy and offered them 
tobacco in order to hear some detail about the corpse and the burial  
but nothing helped even salko said nothing he smoked con  
tinuously and with his one bright eye looked at the smoke which he 
blew as far away as possible from him with strong puffs only those 
two  salko and the fisherman  looked at one another from time to 
time  lifted their little flasks in silence as if pledging something in  
visible and drained them at a gulp 
thus it was that that unusual and unheard of event took place on 
the kapia velje lug did not go down to nezuke and avdaga s fata 
never became the wife of a hamzid  

avdaga osmanagid never again went down into the town  he died 
that same winter  suffocated by his cough  without speaking a word 
to anyone of the sorrow that had killed him 
the next spring mustajbeg hamzid married his son to another girl  
from brankovidi 

for some time the townspeople talked about the incident and then 
began to forget it  all that remained was a song about a girl whose 
beauty and wisdom shone above the world as if it were immortal  


    



ix 




s ome seventy years after the  karageorge insurrection war 
broke out again in serbia and the frontier reacted by rebellion  
once more turkish and serbian houses flamed on the heights  
at    ijeba  gostilje  crmde and veletovo  for the first time after 
so many years the heads of decapitated serbs again appeared on the 
kapia these were thm faced short haired peasant heads with bony 
faces and long moustaches  as though they were the same as those 
exposed seventy years before  but all this did not last long  as soon 
as the war between serbia and turkey ended  the people were again 
left in peace  it was  in truth  an uneasy peace which concealed 
many fearful and exciting rumours and anxious whisperings more 
and more definitely and openly was there talk of the entry of the 
austrian army into bosnia  at the beginning of the summer of      
units of the regular turkish army passed through the town on their 
way from sarajevo to pnboj  the idea spread that the sultan would 
cede bosnia without a struggle  some families made ready to move 
into the sanjak  amongst them some of those who thirty years be  
fore  not wishing to live under serbian rule  had fled from uzice and 
who were now once again preparing to flee from another and 
new christian rule but the majority stayed  awaiting what was to 
come in painful uncertainty and outward indifference  

at the beginning of july the mutti of plevlje arrived with a small 
body of men  filled with a great resolve to organize resistance in 
bosnia against the austrians  a fair haired serious man of calm 
appearance but fiery temperament  he sat on the kapia where  one 
lovely summer s day  he summoned the turkish leaders of the town 
and began to incite them to fight against the austrians he assured 
them that the greater part of the regular army would remain in 
bosnia despite its orders and would join with the people to oppose 
the new conqueror  and called on the young men to join him and the 
townspeople to send provisions to sarajevo  the mufti knew that 
the people of vi egrad had never had the reputation of being en  
thusiastic fighters and that they preferred to live foolishly rather 

    



rhan to die foolishly  but he was none the less surprised at the luke  
warm response that he encountered unable to control himself any 
longer he threatened them with the justice of the people and the 
anger of god  and then left his assistant osman effendi karamanli 
to go on convincing the people of visegrad of the need for their par  
ticipation in a general insurrection  

during the discussions with the multi  the greatest resistance had 
been shown by alihodja mutevelid his family was one of the oldest 
and most respected in the town they had never been noted for their 
fortune  but rather for their honesty and openness they had always 
been reckoned obstinate men  but not susceptible to bribes  intimida  
tion  flattery or any other consideration of lower type for more than 
    years the oldest member of their family had been the muteveha  
the guardian and administrator of mehmed pasha s foundation in the 
town  he looked after the famous stone han near the bridge we 
have seen how  aftei the loss of hungary  the stone han lost the 
revenues on which it depended for its upkeep and by force of cir  
cumstances became a ruin of the vezir s foundation there remained 
only the bridge  a public benefit which did not require special main  
tenance and brought in no revenue  so there remained for the 
mutevelids only their family name as a proud memorial of the call  
ing which they had honourably carried out for so many years that 
calling had in fact ceased at the time when dauthodja had suc  
cumbed in his struggle to maintain the stone han  but the pride had 
remained and with it the traditional custom that the mutevelid 
family was called upon above all others to look after the bridge and 
that it was in some way responsible for its fate  since the bridge was 
an integral part of the great religious foundation which the family 
had administered and which had so pitiably dried up also by long 
established custom one of the mutevelid family went to school and 
belonged to the ulema  the learned body of the moslem clergy now 
it was alihodja otherwise the family had greatly diminished both in 
numbers and property  they now had only a few serfs and a shop  
which they had kept for a long time past  in the best position in the 
market place  quite close to the bridge  two elder brothers of 
alihodja had died in the wars  one in russia and the other in 
montenegro  

alihodja himself was still a young man  lively  healthy and 
smiling  like a real mutevelid he held contrary opinions in every  
thing  defending them tenaciously and sticking to them obstinately  
because of his outspoken nature and independence of his thought 
he was frequently at odds with the local ulema and the moslem 
notables  he had the title and rank of hodja but neither carried out 



any of the duties of that office nor received any income from that 
calling in order to be as independent as possible  he himself looked 
after the shop which had been left by his father  

like the majority of the visegrad moslems  alihodja too was 
opposed to any armed resistance  but in his case there could be no 
question of cowardice or religious lukewarmness  he loathed the 
foreign christian power and all that it would bring with it as much 
as the multi or any of the insurgents  but seeing that the sultan had 
in fact left bosnia at the mercy of the schwabes  for so they called 
the austrians  and knowing his fellow citizens  he was opposed to 
any disorganized popular resistance which could only end in disaster 
and make their misfortune the greater  when once this idea was 
firmly implanted in his mind  he preached it openly and defended 
it with spirit on this occasion too he kept on asking awkward ques  
tions and made sarcastic comments which greatly disconcerted the 
multi  thus unintentionally he sustained among the people of vise  
grad  who in any case would not have been so swift to battle or 
much inclined to make sacrifices  a spirit of open resistance against 
the multi s warlike intentions  

when osman effendi karamanli remained in the town to con  
tinue his discussions with the people  he found himself faced with 
alihodja those few begs and agas who swallowed their words and 
measured their phrases and who in fact were in complete agreement 
with alihodja left it to the sincere and ebullient hodja to come into 
the open and enter into conflict with karamanli  

thus early one evening the leading vi grad turks were sitting on 
the kapia  cross legged in a circle  in the centre was osman effendi  
a tall thin pale man every muscle of his face was unnaturally set  his 
eyes were feverish and his forehead and cheeks marked all over with 
scars like an epileptic before him stood the hodja  reddish in face 
and small in stature  yet somehow impressive  asking more and more 
questions in his thin reedy voice  what forces had they  where were 
they to go  with what means  how  what for  what will happen 
in case of failure  the cold and almost mischievous pedantry with 
which the hodja treated the matter only served to conceal his own 
anxiety and bitterness at the christian superiority and the evident 
weakness and disorder of the turks  but the hot headed and sombre 
osman effendi was not the man to notice or understand such things  
of violent and uncontrolled temper  a fanatic with overstrung 
nerves  he quickly lost patience and control and attacked the hodja 
at every sign of doubt or wavering as if he were a schwabe this 
hodja irritated him and he replied to him only with generalities and 
big words  the main thing was not to allow the foe to enter the coun  



try without resistance  and whoever asked too many questions only 
hindered the good work and aided the enemy in the end  completely 
beside himself  he replied with scarcely concealed disdain to every 
question of the hodja the time has come to die    we will lay down 
our lives    we shall all die to the last man  

 but   bioke in the bodja     understood that you wanted to drive 
the schw abes out of bosnia and that was the reason why you were 
collecting us if it is only a question of dying  then we too know how 
to die  effendi  even without your assistance there is nothing easier 
than to die   

 ama  i can see that you will not be one of those who die   broke 
in karamanli  harshly  

 i can see that you will be one   answered the hodja sarcastically  
 only i do not see w hy you ask for our company m this senseless 
attempt   

the conversation then degenerated into an open quarrel m which 
osman effendi referred to alihodja as a renegade  one of those 
traitors whose heads  like the serbs   should be exposed on the kapia  
while the hodja imperturbably went on splitting hairs and demand  
ing proofs and reasons  as if he had not even heard those threats and 
insults 

indeed it would have been hard to find two worse negotiators or 
more unsuited contestants nothing more could have been expected 
of them than increasing general anxiety and the creation of one 
quarrel the more that was to be regretted  but there was nothing to 
be done about it  for such moments of social upset and great inevit  
able change usually throw up just such men  unbalanced and incom  
plete  to turn things inside out or lead them astray  that is one of the 
signs of times of disorder  

none the less this barren quarrel was a boon to the begs and agas 
for the question of their participation in the insurrection remained 
unanswered and they themselves were not compelled to take sides 
at once  quivering with rage and shouting insults at the top of his 
voice  osman effendi left the next day with a few of his men to 
follow the mufti to sarajevo  

the news which arrived in the course of the month only served 
to confirm the agas and begs in their opportunist view that it would 
be better to preserve their town and their homes  by mid august the 
austrians entered sarajevo  a little later there was a disastrous clash 
on glasinac  which was also the end of all resistance  remnants of 
the routed turkish bands began to descend the steep road from 
lijeska through okoliste  amongst them were some regular soldiers 
who despite the sultan s order had joined the resistance movement 

ii  



of the local insurgents on their own account  the soldiers only asked 
for bread and water and the way on to uvac  but the insurgents were 
bitter and angry men whom the rout had not broken  blackened  
dusty and in rags  they replied curtly to the questions of the peace  
able visegrad turks and made ready to dig trenches and defend the 
bridge  

alihodja was again to the fore  he pointed out indefatigably and 
regardless of consequences that the town could not be defended and 
that resistance was senseless since the  schwabes had already swept 
through bosnia from end to end  the insurgents knew that well 
enough themselves but did not want to acknowledge it  for these 
well fed and well clothed men who had saved their houses and pro  
perties by keeping wisely and cravenly far from the revolt irritated 
and provoked them with them came that same osman effendi 
karamanli  as if out of his mind  paler and thinner than ever  even 
more frenzied and warlike he was one of those men for whom 
failure has no meaning  he spoke of resistance in any place and at 
any price and continually of the need to die before his furious 
ardour everyone retreated or withdrew  save only alihodja  he 
proved to the aggressive osman effendi  without the slightest malice  
coldly and brutally  that what had happened to the revolt was 
exactly what he had foreseen a month ago on this very kapia he 
recommended him to leave with his men as quickly as possible for 
plevlje and not to make bad worse  the hodja was now less aggres  
sive  even to a certain extent compassionate towards this karamanli 
as towards a sick man for within himself  beneath all his outward 
obstinacy the hodja was greatly shaken by the approaching misfor  
tune he was unhappy and embittered as only a true believing mos  
lem could be who sees that a foreign force is approaching inexor  
ably  before whose onslaught the ancient order of islam could not 
long survive that hidden rancour could be felt in his own words 
even against his will  

to all karamanli s insults he replied almost sadly  

 do you think  effendi  that it is easy for me to be alive to await 
the coming of the schwabes to our land  as if we did not know what 
is in store for us in the times to come  we know where it hurts us 
and what we are losing  we know it only too well  if you came here 
to tell us this  you should not have returned here  indeed there was 
no need for you to come from plevlje at all for  as i see  you do not 
understand matters had you done so  you would not have done 
what you have done or said what you have said  this is a worse tor  
ment  effendi  than you can think  nor do i know a remedy for it  
but i know that what you suggest is not a remedy   



but osman effendi was deaf to everything that did not accord 
with his deep and sincere passion for resistance and he hated this 
hodja as much as the schwabes against whom he had revolted  so is 
it always when an overwhelming enemy is near and a great defeat 
certain in every society appear fratricidal hatreds and mutual quar  
rels not finding anything fresh to say  he went on calling alihodja a 
traitor  ironically recommending him to get baptized before the 
schwabes came 

 my ancestors were not baptized  nor will i be i  effendi  have no 
wish either to be baptized with a schwabe or to go to war with an 
idiot   the hodja replied calmly  

all the leading vi egrad turks were of the same opinion as ali  
hodja  but all did not think it discreet to say so  especially so harshly 
and uncompromisingly they were afraid of the austrians who were 
coming but they w ere also afraid of karamanli who with his men 
had taken over control of the town  therefore they shut themselves 
up in their houses or withdrew to their properties outside the town  
and when they could not avoid meeting karamanli and his men 
they looked away or replied with equivocal phrases looking for 
the most convenient pretext and the safest way of extricating 
themselves  

on the level space in front of the ruins of the caravanserai kara  
manh held open court from morning to evening a motley crowd 
was always about him  his own men  chance passers by  those who 
came to beg something from the new master of the town and 
travellers whom the insurgents brought more or less by force in 
front of their leader  and karamanli talked incessantly even when 
he was talking to one man he shouted as if he were addressing hun  
dreds still paler  he rolled his eyes  in which the whites had notice  
ably yellowed  and white foam gathered at the corners of his lips  
one of the townsmen had told him of the moslem tradition about 
sheik turhama who had died there long ago defending the passage 
of the drma against an infidel army and now rested in his grave on 
the farther bank just above the bridge  but who without doubt 
would rise again the moment the first infidel soldier stepped on to 
the bridge  he seized on this legend  feverishly and passionately  ex  
pounding it to the people as a real and unexpected aid  

 brothers  this bridge was a vezir s bequest  it is written that an 
infidel force shall never cross it  it is not we alone who are to defend 
it but also this  holy one   whom rifles cannot hit nor swords cut  
should the foe come  he will rise from his grave and will stand in the 
centre of the bridge with outstretched arms  and when the schwabes 
see him their knees will tremble  and their hearts fail so that they will 



not even be able to run away  turkish brothers  do not disperse but 
all follow me to the bridge   

so karamanh shouted to the crowd  standing stiffly in his black 
shabby cloak  stretching out his arms and showmg how the  holy 
one  would stand  he looked exactly like a tall thin black cross with 
a turban on top  

this the visegrad turks knew even better than karamanli  for 
every one of them had heard and told this legend countless times in 
his childhood  but they none the less showed not the least desire to 
mingle fact with legend or reckon on the help of the dead since noth  
ing could be expected of the living  alihodja  who had not moved 
far from his shop  but to whom the people told all that was said 
or done before the stone han  only waved his arms sorrowfully and 
compassionately  

 i knew that that idiot would not leave either the living or the 
dead in peace allah selamet ohun  may god help us   

but karamanli  helpless before the real enemy  turned all his fury 
against alihodja  he threatened  he shouted and swore that before 
he was forced to leave the town he would nail the obstinate hodja to 
the kapia like a badger to await the schwabes in that way  since he 
did not want to fight or to allow others to do so 

all this bickering was cut short by the appearance of the austrians 
on the lijeska slopes then it was seen that the town really could 
not be defended karamanli was the last to leave the town  abandon  
ing on the raised level space before the caravanserai both the iron 
cannons that he had dragged there but before he left he carried out 
his threat he ordered his servant  a smith by profession  a man of 
giant size but with the brain of a bird  to bind alihodja and to nail 
him by the right ear to that oak beam wedged between two stone 
steps on the kapia  which was all that remained of the former 
blockhouse  

in the general crush and confusion which reigned in the market  
place and around the bridge  all heard that order given in a loud 
voice but no one even dreamed that it would be carried out in the 
form in which it was given in such circumstances all sorts of things  
brave words and loud curses  can be heard  so too it was in this case 
at first sight the thing seemed inconceivable  it was to be considered 
a threat or an insult or something of the sort  nor did alihodja him  
self take the matter very seriously  even the smith himself who had 
been ordered to carry it out and who was busy spiking the guns 
hesitated and seemed to think it over  but the thought that the hodja 
must be nailed to the kapia was in the air and the suspicious and em  
bittered townsmen turned over in their minds the prospects and 



piobabilities of such a cnmc being earned out or not earned out  
would it be  or would it not be  at first the majority of them 
thought the affair to be  as indeed it was  senseless  ugly and impos  
sible but in moments of general excitement  something has to be 
done  something big and unusual  and that was the only thing to be 
done  would it be  or would it not be  the possibility seemed 
stronger and became eveiy moment and with every movement more 
probable and more natural why not  two men already held the 
hodja who did not defend himself overmuch they bound his hands 
behind his back but all this was still far from so mad and terrible a 
reality  but it was coming nearer and nearer  the smith  as if sud  
denly ashamed of his weakness and indecision  produced from some  
where or other the hammer with which a short time before he had 
been spiking the guns the thought that the schwabes were so to 
speak already here  half an hour s march from the town  gave him 
the resolution to bring the matter to a head and with this same 
painful thought the hodja obstinately maintained his indifference to 
everything  even towards that mad  undeserved and shameful 
punishment lo which they had condemned him 

so in a few moments there took place what in any one of those 
moments would have seemed impossible and incredible there was 
no one who w ould have considered that this deed was good or pos  
sible  yet everyone to some extent played his part in the fact that 
the hodja found himself on the biidge nailed by his right ear to a 
wooden beam which was on the kapia   and when everyone fled in 
all directions before the schwabes who were coming down the 
slopes into the town  the hodja remained in this strange but comic 
position  forced to kneel motionless since every movement  even the 
slightest  was exceedingly painful and threatened to tear off his ear  
which seemed to him as heavy and as large as a mountain  he cried 
out  but there was no one to hear him or release him from his pain  
ful situation for everything living had hidden in the houses or scat  
tered into the villages for fear  partly of the schwabes who were 
coming and partly of the insurgents who were leaving the town 
seemed dead and the bridge as empty as if death had swept it clean 
there was neither living nor dead to defend it  only on the kapia the 
motionless alihodja crouched down with his head stuck to the beam  
groaning with pain but even in this position thinking up fresh proofs 
against karamanli 

the austrians approached slowly  from the farther bank their 
patrols had seen the two cannons in front of the caravanserai and 
they at once halted to await the arrival of their mountain guns  
about midday they fired a few shells from the shelter of a little wood 


    



at the deserted caravanserai they damaged the already ruined ban 
and destroyed those exceptionally fine window grilles  each cut 
from a single piece of soft stone  only after they had got the range 
and overturned the two turkish cannons and seen that they were 
abandoned and that no one replied did the schwabes cease their fire 
and begin to approach the bridge and the town with every precau  
tion  some magyar honveds approached the kapia slowly with their 
rifles at the ready  they halted in uncertainty before the huddled 
hodja who in fear of the shells  which had whistled and grumbled 
above his head  had for a moment forgotten the pain from his nailed 
ear when he saw the hated soldiers with their rifles trained on him  
he began to utter piteous and prolonged sobs  since that was a 
language that everyone understood  this prevented him from being 
shot  some of them continued their slow advance step by step across 
the bridge while others remained by him looking at him more closely 
and unable to understand his position only when a hospital orderly 
arrived did they find a pair of pliers  carefully extracted the nail  one 
of those used for shoeing horses  and released alihodja  so stiff and 
exhausted was he that he collapsed on the stone step  groaning and 
sobbing the orderly dressed his ear with some sort of liquid which 
stung through his tears the hodja as if in a strange dream looked at 
the broad white band on the soldier s left arm and on it a large regu  
lar cross in red material  only in fever could such repulsive and ter  
rible sights be seen  this cross swam and danced before his eyes and 
filled his whole horizon like a nightmare  then the soldier bound up 
his wound and fixed his turban over the bandage  his head thus ban  
daged  and as if broken in his loins  the hodja dragged himself to his 
feet and remained so for some moments leaning on the stone parapet 
of the bridge  with difficulty he collected himself and regained his 
calm  

opposite him  on the far side of the kapia  beneath the turkish in  
scnption in the stone  a soldier had affixed a large white paper  
though his head was throbbing with pain the hodja could not re  
strain his curiosity and looked at that white placard  it was a pro  
clamation by general filipovid  in serbian and turkish  addressed 
to the population of bosnia and herzegovina on the occasion of the 
entry of the austrian army into bosnia screwing up his right eye  
alihodja spelt out the turkish text  but only those sentences printed 
in large letters  

 people of bosnia and herzegovina  

 the army of the emperor of austria and king of hungary has 
crossed the frontier of your country  it does not come as an enemy 
to take the land by force  it comes as a fnend to put an end to the 


i i 



disorders which for years past have disturbed not only bosnia and 
herzegovina but also the frontier districts of austria hungary  

the king umperor could no longer see how violence and disorder 
ruled in the neighbourhood of his dominions and how misery and 
misfortune knocked at the frontiers of his lands 

 he has drawn the attention of the european states to your posi  
tion and at a council of the nations it has been unanimously decided 
that austria hungary shall restore to you the peace and prosperity 
that you have so long lost  

 his majesty the sultan who has your good at heart has felt it 
necessary to confide you to the protection of his powerful friend the 
king emperor 

the king emperor decrees that all sons of this land shall enjoy the 
same rights before the law and that the lives  faith and property of 
all shall be protected 

 people of bosnia and herzegovina  put yourselves with confi  
dence under the protection of the glorious standards of austria  
hungary welcome our soldiers as friends  submit yourselves to the 
authorities and return to your occupations the fruits of your toil 
wnll be protected   

the hodjq read haltingly  sentence by sentence he did not under  
stand eveiy woid   et every word caused him pain  a special sort of 
pain completely distinct from those pains which he felt in his 
wounded ear  in his head and in his loins only now  from these 
words  these  imperial w ords   was it at once clear to him that every  
thing was ended for them  all that was his and theirs  ended m some 
strange fashion once and for all  eyes go on seeing  lips speaking  
man goes on living but life  real life  exists no more a foreign tsar 
had put his hand on them and a foreign faith ruled  that emerged 
clearly from those big words and obscure commands  and still more 
clearly from that leaden pam in his breast which was fiercer and 
harder to bear than any human pain that could be imagined it was 
not thousands of fools like that osman karamanli who could do 
anything or change anything  thus the hodja continued to argue 
within himself    we shall all die    we must die   what was the use 
of all that hullabaloo when  here and now  there had come for a man 
a time of disaster in which he could neither live nor die  but rotted 
like a stake in the earth and belonged to whomever you wished but 
not himself that was the great misery which the karamanlis of all 
sorts did not see and could not understand and which by their lack 


    



of understanding they made even heavier and more shameful  

deep in his thoughts alihodja slowly left the bridge  he did not 
even notice that the austrian red cross man was accompanying him  
his ear did not pain him as much as that leaden and bitter pain which 
had risen in his breast after reading  the imperial words   he walked 
slowly and it seemed to him that never again would he cross to the 
farther bank  that this bridge which was the pride of the town and 
ever since its creation had been so closely linked with it  on which 
he had grown up and beside which he had spent his life  was now 
suddenly broken in the middle  right there at the kapw  that this 
white paper of the proclamation had cut it in half like a silent ex  
plosion and that there was now a great abyss  that individual piers 
still stood to right and to left of this break but that there was no way 
across  for the bridge no longer linked the two banks and every man 
had to remain on that side where he happened to be at this moment  

alihodja walked slowly  immersed in these feverish visions  he 
seemed like a seriously wounded man and his eyes continually filled 
with tears  he walked hesitantly as if he were a beggar who  ill  was 
crossing the bridge for the first time and entering a strange unknown 
town  voices aroused him  beside him walked some soldiers  
amongst them he saw that fat  good natured  mocking face of the 
man with a red cross on his arm who had taken out the nail  still 
smiling  the soldier pointed to his bandage and asked him something 
in an incomprehensible language  the hodja thought that he was 
offering to help him and at once stiffened and said sullenly  

 i can myself   need no one s help   

and with a livelier and more determined step he made his way 
home

t he formal and official entry of the austrian troops took 
place the following day 

no one could remember such a silence as then fell on the 
town  the shops did not even open the doors and windows 
of the houses remained shuttered though it was a warm sunny day 
towards the end of august the streets were empty  the courtyards 
and gardens as if dead  in the turkish houses depression and confu  
sion reigned  in the christian houses caution and distrust  but every  
where and for everyone there was fear the entering austrians 
feared an ambush the turks feared the austrians the serbs feared 
both austrians and turks the jews feared everything and every  
one since  especially in times of war  everyone was stronger than 
they the rumbling of the previous day s guns was in everyone s 
ears but even if men were now only listening to their own fear  no 
one living that day would have dared to poke his nose out of doors  
but man has other masters the austrian detachment which had 
entered the town the day before had routed out the police chief and 
gendarmes  the officer in command of the detachment had returned 
his sword to the police chief and ordered him to continue his duties 
and maintain order m the town  he told him that at one hour before 
noon next day the commandant  a colonel  would arrive and that 
the leading men of the town  that was to say the representatives of 
the three faiths  were to be there to meet him when he entered the 
town  grey and resigned  the police chief at once summoned mula 
ibrahim  husseinaga the schoolmaster  pop nikola  and the rabbi 
david levi and informed them that as  recognized notables  they must 
await the austrian commandant next day at noon on the kapia  must 
welcome him in the name of the citizens and accompany him to the 
market place  

long before the appointed time the four  recognized notables  met 
on the deserted square and walked with slow steps to the kapia al  
ready the assistant chief of police  salko hedo  with the aid of a 
gendarme  had spread out a long turkish carpet in bright colours to 

    



cover the steps and the middle of the stone seat on which the aus  
trian commandant was to sit they stood there together for some 
time  solemn and silent  then seeing that there was no trace of the 
commandant along the white road from okoliste  they looked at one 
another and as if by common consent sat down on the uncovered 
part of the stone bench  pop nikola drew out a huge leather tobacco 
pouch and offered it to the others  

so they sat on the kapia as they had once done when they were 
young and carefree and like the rest of the young people wasted their 
time there  only now they were all advanced in years  pop nikola 
and mula ibrahim were old  and the schoolmaster and the rabbi in 
the prime of life  they were all in their best clothes  filled with 
anxiety both for themselves and for their flocks  they looked at one 
another closely and long in the fierce summer sun  and each seemed 
to the others grown old for his years and worn out each of them 
remembered the others as they had been in youth or childhood  when 
they had grown up on this bridge  each in his own generation  green 
wood of which no one could tell what would be 

they smoked and talked of one thing while turning another over 
m their minds  glancing every moment towards okoliste whence the 
commandant upon whom everything depended was to come and 
who could bring them  their people and the whole town  either good 
or evil  either peace or fresh dangers  

pop nikola was undoubtedly the most calm and collected of the 
four  or at least seemed so he had passed his seventieth year but was 
still fresh and strong son of the celebrated pop mihailo whom the 
turks had beheaded on this very spot  pop nikola had passed a 
stormy youth  he had several times fled into serbia to take refuge 
there from the hatred and revenge of certain turks  his indomitable 
nature and his conduct had often given occasion both for hatred and 
revenge  but when the troublous years had passed  pop mihailovs son 
had settled down in his old parish  married  and calmed down  those 
times were long ago and now forgotten    my character has changed 
long ago and our turks have become peaceable   pop nikola would 
say in jest   for fifty years now pop nikola had administered his 
widespread  scattered and difficult frontier parish calmly and  wisely  
without other major upheavals and misfortunes than those which 
life brings normally in its tram  with the devotion of a slave and the 
dignity of a prince  always just and equitable with turks  people 
and leaders  

neither before him nor after him in any class of men or in any 
faith was there a man who enjoyed such general respect and such a 
reputation amongst all the townspeople without distinction of faith  


i s 



sex or years  as this priest whom everyone called  grandad  he re  
presented for the whole town the serbian church and all that the 
people called or regarded as christianity the people looked on him 
as the perfect type of priest and leader so far as this town in these 
conditions could imagine one 

he was a man of great stature and exceptional physical strength  
not over literate but of great heart  sound common sense and a serene 
and open spirit his smile disarmed  calmed and encouraged it was 
the indescribable smile of a man who lives at peace with himself and 
with everything around him  his big green eyes contracted into nar  
row slits whence flashed golden sparks and so he remained in old 
age in his long overcoat of fox fur  with his great red beard just be  
ginning to turn grey with the years and which covered his whole 
chest  with his enormous hood beneath w hich his flowing hair was 
plaited into a pigtail  he walked through the market place as if he 
had indeed been the priest of this town beside the bridge and all this 
mountainous district  not for fifty years only and not for his church 
only  but from time immemorial  from those times when the people 
were not divided into their present faiths and churches  from the 
shops on both sides of the market place the merchants greeted him  
whatever their faith women stood to one side and waited with 
bowed head for  grandad  to pass the children  even the jewish 
ones  left off their play and stopped shouting and the oldest among 
them  solemnly and timidly  would come up to the enormous hand 
of  grandad  to feel it for a moment on their shaven heads and faces 
heated by play  and hear his merry and powerful voice fall upon 
them like a good and pleasant dew  

 god grant you life  god grant you life  my son   

this token of respect towards  grandad  had become a part of the 
ancient and universally recognized ceremonial in which generations 
of the townsfolk had grown up  

but even in pop nikola s life there was one shadow his marriage 
had remained childless that was  without doubt  a heavy blow but 
no one could recall having heard a bitter word or seen a regretful 
glance either from him or from his wife  in their house they always 
maintained at their own expense at least two children belonging to 
some of their relatives in the villages these they would look after 
until they married  and then find others  

next to pop nikola sat mula ibrahim  a tall  thin  dried up man 
with a sparse beard and pendulant moustaches he was not much 
younger than pop nikola  had a large family and a fine property left 
him by his father  but he was so slipshod  thin and timid  that he 
seemed with his clear blue childlike eyes more like some hermit or 

    



some poor and pious pilgrim than the hodja of visegrad  descendant 
of many hodjas mula ibrahim had one affliction  he stuttered in his 
speech  long and painfully   a man must have nothing to do before 
he can talk with mula ibrahim   the townsmen used to say in jest    
but mula ibrahim was known for far around for his goodness and 
generosity  mildness and serenity breathed out of him and at the first 
meeting men forgot his outward appearance and his stutter  he 
attracted all who were overburdened by illness  poverty or any other 
misfortune  from the most distant villages men came to ask advice 
of mula ibrahim before his house there was always a crowd to see 
him  and men and women often stopped him in the street to seek his 
advice  he never refused anyone and never handed out expensive 
charms or amulets as other hodjas did  he would sit down at once in 
the first patch of shade or on the first stone  a little to the side  the 
man would then tell all his troubles in a whisper  mula ibrahim 
would listen attentively and sympathetically  then say a few good 
words to him  always finding the best possible solution for his 
troubles  or would thrust his thin hand into the deep pocket of his 
cloak  taking care not to be overseen by anyone  and slip a few coins 
into his hand nothing was difficult or repugnant or impossible to 
him if it were a question of helping some moslem for that he could 
always find time and money  nor did his stutter hinder him in this  
for when whispering with his co religionist in misfortune he forgot 
to stutter  everyone went away from him if not completely con  
soled  then at least momentarily relieved  for it could be seen that 
he felt their misfortunes as if they were his own continually sur  
rounded with every sort of trouble and need and never thinking of 
himself  he none the less  or so it seemed  passed his whole life 
healthy  happy and rich  

the visegrad schoolmaster  hussein effendi  was a smallish plump 
man  well dressed and well cared for  he had a short black beard 
carefully trimmed in a regular oval about his pink and white face 
with round black eyes  he had been well educated and knew a good 
deal  but pretended to know much more and deceived himself that 
he knew even more he loved to talk and to have an audience he 
was convinced that he spoke well and that led him to speak a lot  
he expressed himself carefully and affectedly with studied gestures  
holding his arms up a little  both at the same height  with white soft 
hands with pinkish nails  shadowed by short black hairs  when 
speaking he behaved as if he were in front of a mirror he had the 
largest library in the town  a bound chest full of books kept care  
fully locked  which had been bequeathed him by his teacher  the 
celebrated arap hodja  and which he not only conscientiously pre  


    



served from dust and moth but even on rare occasions read  but the 
mere knowledge that he had  so great a number of such valuable 
books gave him lepute amongst men who did not know what a book 
was  and raised his value in his own eyes it was known that he was 
writing a chronicle of the most important events in the history of the 
town among the citizens this gave him the fame of a learned and 
exceptional man  for it was considered that by this he held in some 
way the fate of the town and of every individual in it in his hands 
in actual fact that chronicle was neither extensive nor dangerous in 
the last five or six years  since the schoolmaster had first begun this 
work  only four pages of a small exercise book had been filled for 
the greater number of the town s events were not considered by the 
schoolmaster as of sufficient importance to warrant entry into his 
chronicle and for that reason it remained as unfruitful  dry and 
empty as a proud old maid 

the fourth of the  notables  was david levi  the visegrad rabbi  
grandson of that famous old rabbi had i liacho who had left him as 
inheritance his name  position and property but nothing of his spirit 
and his serenity  

he was pale and puny  with dark velvety eyes and melancholy ex  
pression  he was inconceivably timid and silent he had only re  
cently become rabbi and had married not long before in order to 
seem bigger and more important he wore a wide rich suit of heavy 
cloth and his face was overgrown with beard and whiskers  but be  
neath all this one could discern a weak sickly body and the childish 
oval of his face peered out fearfully from the black sparse beard  he 
suffered terribly whenever he had to appear in public and take his 
part in discussions and decisions  always feeling himself to be weak 
and undeveloped  

now all four of them sat in the sun and sweated under their for  
mal clothes  more moved and anxious than they wished to show  

 let s light another one  we ve time  by the soul of my grand  
mother  he s no bird to fly down to the bridge   said pop nikola  
like a man who has long learnt how to conceal with a jest his own 
and others  thoughts and fears  

all looked at the okoliste road and then went on smoking 

the conversation flowed slowly and carefully  forever coming 
back to the imminent welcome to the commandant  all were agreed 
that it was pop nikola who should greet him and bid him welcome  
with half closed eyes and brows furrowed so that his eyes became 
those two golden studded slits that formed his smile  pop nikola 
looked at the three others long  silently and intently  

the rabbi was quivering with fright  he had hardly strength to 

    



puff the smoke away from him but let it linger in his moustaches and 
beard  the schoolmaster was no less scared  all his eloquence and his 
dignity as a man of learning had vanished suddenly the day before 
he was very far from realizing how disconsolate he looked and how 
greatly he was scared  for the high opinion which he had of himself 
did not allow him to believe anything of the sort  he tried to deliver 
one of his literary addresses with his studied gestures that explained 
everything  but his fine hands only fell into his lap and his words be  
came mixed up and halting  even he himself wondered where his 
customary dignity had vanished  and vainly tormented himself try  
ing to recover it  as something to which he had long been accustomed 
and which now  when he needed it most  had somehow deserted 
him  

mula ibrahim was somewhat paler than usual but otherwise calm 
and collected  he and pop nikola looked at one another from time to 
time as if they understood one another by their eyes alone they 
had been close acquaintances smce youth and good friends  insofar 
as one could speak of friendship between a turk and a serb in times 
as they then were  when pop nikola in his youthful years had had 
his  troubles  with the visegrad turks and had had to fly for refuge  
mula ibrahim  whose father had been very influential m the town  
had been of some service to him  later  when more peaceful times 
had come and relations between the two faiths had become more 
bearable and the two of them were already grown men  they had 
made friends and called one another  neighbour  in jest  for their 
houses were at opposite ends of the town on occasions of drought  
flood  epidemic or other misfortune they found themselves working 
together  each among men of their own faith otherwise  whenever 
they met at mejdan or okoliste  they greeted one another and asked 
after one another s health  as priest and hodja never did elsewhere  
then pop nikola would often point with his pipestem at the town 
beside the river and say half in jest  

 all that breathes or creeps or speaks with human voice down 
there is either your or my responsibility   

 it is so  neighbour   mula ibrahim would stutter in reply   indeed 
they are   

 and so the townsmen who could always find time to mock at 
everyone and everything would say of men who lived in friendship  
 they are as close as the priest and the hodja    and this saying became 
a proverb with them   

these two now understood one another perfectly though they did 
not exchange a word  pop nikola knew how hard it was for mula 
ibrahim and mula ibrahim knew that it was not easy for the priest  

e     



the  looked at one another as they had done so many times before 
in their lives and on so many different occasions  as two men who 
had on their souls that double burden of the town  the one for those 
w ho crossed themselves  the other for those who bowed down in the 
mosque 

at that moment the sound of trotting was heard and a turkish 
gendarme hurried up on a scraggy pony  scared and out of breath  
he shouted at them from a distance like a town cner  

 here he is  the one on the white horse   

the police chief too arrived  alw ays calm  always amiable  always 
silent 

dust rose from along the okoliste road 

these men  born and brought up in this remote district of turkey  
the rotten npe turkey of the nineteenth century  had naturally never 
had the chance of seeing the real  powerful and well organized army 
of a great power all that they had been able to see till then had been 
the incomplete  badly fed  badly clothed and badly paid units of the 
sultan s askers or  which was even worse  the bosnian irregulars  the 
bashibazouks  recruited by force  undisciplined and fanatic  now for 
the first time there appeared before them the real  power and force  
of an empire  victorious  glistening and sure of itself  such an army 
dazzled them and checked the words in their throats  at the first 
sight of the saddlery and the tunic buttons another world could be 
sensed behind these hussars and jaegers in parade kit  their astonish  
ment was great and the impression profound  

first rode two trumpeters on two fat bays  then a detachment of 
hussars on black horses  the horses were well groomed and moved 
like girls with short tidy steps  the hussars  all young and fresh  with 
waxed moustaches  m red shakos and yellow frogged tunics  seemed 
rested and vigorous as if they had just come out of barracks  behind 
them rode a group of six officers led by a colonel  all eyes were fixed 
on him  his horse was larger than the others  a flea bitten grey with a 
very long and curved neck  a little behind the officers came the in  
fantry detachment  jaegers  in green uniforms  with a panache of 
feathers on their leather caps and white bands across their chests 
they shut out everything save themselves and seemed like a moving 
forest  

the trumpeters and hussars rode past the priest and the police 
chief  halted on the market place  and drew up along the sides  

the men on the kapia  pale and shaken  stood in the centre of the 
bridge facing the officers  one of the younger officers spurred his 
horse up to the colonel and said something to him  all slowed down 
a few paces in front of the  notables  the colonel suddenly halted 



and dismounted  as did the officers behind him as if by order the 
soldiers whose duty it was to hold the horses hurried up and led them 
a tew paces back  

as soon as his foot touched the ground  the colonel seemed another 
man he was a small  undistinguished  overtired  unpleasant and 
aggressive man  behaving as if he alone had fought for all of them 
only now could it be seen that he was simply dressed  dishevelled 
and ungroomed  in contrast to his pale faced smartly uniformed 
officers he was the image of a man who drives himself mercilessly  
who continually overtaxes himself  his face was flushed  his beard 
untnmmed  his eyes troubled and anxious  his tall helmet a little on 
one side and his crumpled uniform seemingly too big for his body 
he was wearing cavalry boots of soft unpolished leather  walking 
with legs apart like a horseman he came closer  swinging his riding  
crop one of the officers spoke to him  pointing out the men ranged 
before him the colonel looked at them shortly and sharply  the 
angiy glance of a man continually occupied with difficult duties and 
great dangers it was at once evident that he did not know how to 
look in any other way  

at that moment pop nikola began to speak in a calm deep voice  
the colonel looked up and fixed his gaze on the face of the big man 
m the black cloak that broad serene mask of a biblical patriarch 
held his attention for a moment  it may be that he did not under  
stand  or that he pretended not to listen to  what the old man was 
saying  but that face could not go unnoticed  pop nikola spoke 
fluently and naturally  addressing himself more to the young officer 
who was to translate his words than to the colonel himself in the 
name of all the faiths here present  he assured the colonel that they  
and their people  were willing to submit themselves to the coming 
authorities and would do all that was in their power to maintain 
peace and order as the new authorities demanded  they asked the 
army to protect them and their families and make a peaceful life and 
honest toil possible for them  

pop nikola spoke shortly and ended abruptly  the nervous 
colonel did not have any excuse to lose patience  but all the same he 
did not wait for the end of the young officer s translation  brandish  
ing his ridmg crop  he interrupted him in a harsh and uneven voice  

 good  good  all those who behave themselves will be protected 
peace and order must be maintained ever  where  it must be  whether 
they like it or not   

then  shaking his head  he moved onward without a glance or a 
greeting  the  notables  moved aside the colonel passed them  fol  
lowed by the officers and the orderlies with the horses  none of them 



paid the least attention to the  notables  who remained alone on the 
kapia 

all of them were disillusioned  for the day before  and all through 
the previous night  in which not one of them had slept much  each 
had asked himself a hundred times what that moment would be like 
when they had to welcome the commandant of the imperial army on 
the kapia they had imagined him in every sort of way  each accord  
ing to his nature and intelligence  and had been ready for the worst  
some of them had already seen themselves tarried away immediately 
to exile in faraway austria  never again to see their homes or their 
town  others remembered the stones about hairuddin who at one 
time used to cut off heads on this very kapia  they had imagined in 
every possible way  save that m which it had actually happened  the 
meeting with that small but curt and bad tempered officer to whom 
war was life  who did not think of himself or pay any heed to others  
but saw all men and all lands only as a subject or an occasion for 
war and conflict  and who behaved as if he were waging war on his 
own account and in his own name  

so they stood  looking at one another in uncertainty  each of their 
looks seemed to say dumbly   we have got out of this alive  have we 
really gone through the worst  what is still in store for us and what 
must be done   

the police chief and pop nikola were the first to come to them  
selves  they came to the conclusion that the  notables  had done their 
duty and that nothing more was left for them to do but to go home 
and tell the people not to be frightened and run away  but to take 
good care what they did the others  without blood in their faces or 
thoughts in their heads  accepted this conclusion as they would have 
accepted any other  since they themselves were in no state to come 
to any conclusion  

the police chief  whom nothing could ruffle  w ent about his duties  
the gendarme rolled up the long multicoloured carpet which had not 
been fated to receive the visit of the commandant  with salko hedo 
standing beside him as cold and unfeeling as fate  meanwhile the 
 notables  dispersed each in his own way and each in his own direc  
tion  the rabbi hurried off with tiny steps in order to get home as 
soon as possible and feel again the warmth and protection of the 
family circle in which his mother and his wife lived  the school  
master left more slowly  deep in thought  now that everything had 
passed so unexpectedly well and easily  though harshly and un  
pleasantly enough  it seemed to him quite clear that there had never 
been any real reason for panic and it seemed to him that he had 
never in fact been afraid of anyone  he thought only what import  

    



ance this event should have in his chronicle and how much space 
should be devoted to it  a score of lines should be enough  perhaps 
even fifteen  or maybe less  the nearer he got to his house the more 
he reduced the number with every line spared it seemed to him that 
he saw all around him diminished in importance while he  the 
schoolmaster  became greater and more important in his own eyes  

mula ibrahim and pop nikola walked together as far as the slope 
leading to mejdan  they both remained silent  astonished and dis  
couraged at the appearance and bearing of the impenal colonel  
both were hastening to get home as soon as possible and foregather 
with their families  at the point where their paths diverged  they 
stood and looked at one another for a moment in silence  mula 
ibrahim rolled his eyes and moved his lips as if continually chewing 
over some word that he was unable to utter pop nikola  who had 
once more recovered his smile of golden sparks which encouraged 
both himself and the hodja  uttered his own and the hod a s thought  

 a bloody business  this army  mula ibrahim   

tou are right  a b b b bloody business   stuttered mula ibrahim 
raising his arms and saying farewell with a movement of his head  

pop nikola went back to his house by the church  slowly and 
heavily his wife who was waiting for him asked no questions  she 
at once took off his boots  took his cloak and removed the hood 
from the thick sweaty mass of red and grey hair he sat down on a 
low divan  on its wooden arm a glass of water and a lump of sugar 
were ready waiting  after refreshing himself and lighting a cigar he 
closed his eyes wearily  but in his inmost thoughts still flashed the 
image of that colonel  like a flash of lightning that dazzles a man and 
fills his whole field of vision so that nothing else may be seen and yet 
it is impossible to look away from it  the priest puffed his smoke far 
away from him with a sigh and then spoke quietly as if to himself  

 a strange sort of bastard  on my grandmother s soul   

from the town could be heard a drum and then a bugle of the 
jaeger detachment  gay and penetrating  a new and unusual melody

t hus the great change in the life of the town beside the bridge 
took place without sacrifices other than the martyrdom of 
alihodja after a few days life went on again as before 
and seemed essentially unchanged even alihodja himself 
plucked up his courage and opened his shop near the bridge like 
all the other traders  save that now he wore his turban slightly 
tipped to the right so that the scar on his wounded ear could not 
be seen that  leaden weight  which he had felt in his chest after 
seeing the led cross on the arm of the austrian orderly and reading 
the  imperial words  had not actually vanished  but it had become 
quite small like the bead of a rosary  so that it was possible to live 
with it  nor was he the only one who felt such a weight 
so began the new era under the occupation which the people  
unable to prevent  considered in their hearts to be temporary  what 
did not pass across the bridge m those first few years after the 
occupation  yellow military vehicles rumbled across it in long 
convoys bringing food  clothing and furniture  instruments and 
fittings hitherto unheard of  

at first only the army was to be seen  soldiers sprang up  like 
water from the earth  behind every corner and every bush the 
market place was full of them  but they were also in every part 
of the town  every minute of the day some fnghtened woman 
would scream  having unexpectedly come across a soldier in her 
courtyard or in the plum orchard behind her house  in dark blue 
uniforms  tanned by two months of marching and fighting  glad 
that they were alive and eager for rest and enjoyment  they 
sauntered through the town and the country around  few of the 
citizens went to the kapia for now it was always full of soldiers  
they would sit there  singing in various languages and buying 
fruit in their blue leather peaked caps with a yellow metal cocitede 
on which was cut the imperial initials fji  

but when autumn came the soldiers began to move away  slowly 
and imperceptibly there seemed fewer and fewer of them  there 


    



remained only the gendarme detachments  these requisitioned 
houses and prepared for a long stay  at the same time officials 
began to arrive  civil servants with their families and  after them  
artisans and craftsmen for all those trades which up till then had 
not existed m the town  among them were czechs  poles  croats  
hungarians and austrians 

at first it seemed that they had come by chance  as if driven 
by the wind  and as if they were coming for a short stay to live 
more or less the same life as had always been lived here  as though 
the civil authorities were to prolong for a short time the occupation 
begun by the army  but with every month that passed the number 
of newcomers increased  however  what most astonished the 
people of the town and filled them with wonder and distrust was 
not so much their numbers as their immense and incomprehensible 
plans  their untiring industry and the perseverance with which they 
proceeded to the realization of those plans  the newcomers were 
never at peace  and they allowed no one else to live in peace  
it seemed that they were resolved with their impalpable yet ever 
more noticeable web of laws  regulations and orders to embrace 
all foims of life  men  beasts and things  and to change and alter 
everything  both the outward appearance of the town and the 
customs and habits of men from the cradle to the grave all this 
they did quietly without many words  without force or provocation  
so that a man had nothing to protest about if they encountered 
resistance or lack of understanding  they at once stopped  discussed 
the matter somewhere out of sight and then changed only the 
manner and direction of their work  still carrying out whatever 
was in their minds every task that they began seemed useless 
and even silly  they measured out the waste land  numbered the 
trees m the forest  inspected lavatories and drains  looked at the 
teeth of horses and cows  asked about the illnesses of the people  
noted the number and types of fruit trees and of different kinds 
of sheep and poultry   it seemed that they were playing games  
so incomprehensible  unreal and futile all these tasks of theirs 
appeared to the people   then all that they had carried out with 
so much care and zeal vanished somewhere or other as if it had 
been lost without trace or sound  but a few months later  some  
times even a year later  when the whole thing had been completely 
forgotten by the people  the real sense of these measures which 
had seemed so senseless was suddenly revealed the mukhtars of 
the individual quarters would be summoned to the konak  the 
administrative centre  and told of a new regulation against forest 
felling  or of the fight against typhus  or the manner of sale of 


    



fruit and sweetmeats  or of permits for the moiement of cattle  
every day a fresh regulation with each regulation men saw their 
individual liberties curtailed or their obligations increased  but 
the life of the town and the villages  and of all their inhabitants as a 
mass  became wider and fuller  

but in the homes  not only of the turks but also of the serbs  
nothing was changed they lived  worked and amused themselves 
in the old way bread was  still mixed in kneading troughs  coffee 
roasted on the hearth  clothes steamed in coppers and washed 
with soda which hurt the women s fingers  they still span and wove 
on tambours and hand looms old customs of slavas  patronal 
feasts   holidays and weddings were kept up in every detail and as 
for the new customs which the newcomers had brought with them 
there were only whispers here and there as of something far off 
and incredible  in short  they lived and worked as they had always 
done and as in most of the houses they would continue to work 
and live for another fifteen or twenty years after the occupation  

but on the other hand the outward aspect of the town altered 
visibly and rapidly those same people  who in their own homes 
maintained the old order in every detail and did not even dream 
of changing anything  became for the most part easily reconciled 
to the changes in the town and after a longer or shorter period 
of wonder and grumbling accepted them  naturally here  as always 
and everywhere in similar circumstances  the new life meant in 
actual fact a mingling of the old and the new  old ideas and old 
values clashed with the new ones  merged with them or existed 
side by side  as if waiting to see which would outlive which 
people reckoned in florins and kreutzers but also in grosh and para  
measured by arshin and oka and drams but also by metres and 
kilos and grams  confirmed terms of payment and orders by the 
new calendar but even more often by the old custom of payment 
on st  george s or st  dimitri s day  by a natural law the people 
resisted every innovation but did not go to extremes  for to most 
of them life was always more important and more urgent than 
the forms by which they lived  only in exceptional individuals was 
there played out a deeper  truer drama of the struggle between the 
old and the new  for them the forms of life were indivisibly 
and unconditionally linked with life itself  

such a man was shemsibeg brankovid of cm e  one of the richest 
and most respected begs in the town  he had six sons  of whom 
four were already married  their houses comprised a whole small 
 quarter surrounded by fields  plum orchards and shrubberies  shem  
sibeg was the undisputed chief  the strict and silent master of this 

    



community tall  bent with years  with a huge white gold em  
broidered turban on his head  he only came down to the market 
to pray m the mosque on fridays  from the first day of the occupa  
tion he stopped nowhere in the town  spoke to no one and would 
not look about him  not the smallest piece of new clothing or 
costume  not a new tool or a new word was allowed to enter 
the brankovid house not one of his sons had any connection with 
the new authorities and his grandchildren were not allowed to go 
to school all the brankovid community suffered from this  amongst 
his sons there was dissatisfaction at the old man s obstinacy but 
none of them dared to oppose him by a single word or a single 
glance  those turks from the market place  who worked and 
mingled with the newcomers  greeted sheipsibeg when he passed 
through the market with a dumb respect in which was mingled 
fear and admiration and an uneasy conscience  the oldest and most 
respected turks of the town often went to crnfe as if on a pil  
grimage to sit and talk with shemsibeg  those were meetings of 
men who were determined to persevere in their resistance to the 
end and were unwilling to yield in any way to reality  these 
were  in fact  long sessions without many words and without real 
conclusions  

shemsibeg sat and smoked on a red rug  cloaked and buttoned 
up m summer as in winter  with his guests around him  their 
conversation was usually about some new incomprehensible and 
sinister measure of the occupation authonties  or of those turks 
who were more and more accommodating themselves to the new 
order before this harsh and dignified man  they all felt the need 
to give vent to their bitterness  their fears and their uncertainties 
every conversation ended with the questions  where is all this 
leading and where will it stop  who and what were these strangers 
who  it seemed  did not know the meaning of rest and respite  knev  
neither measure nor limits  what did they want  with what plans 
had they come  what was this restlessness which continually 
drove them on  like some curse  to new works and enterprises 
of which no one could see the end  

shemsibeg only looked at them and for the most part remained 
silent  his face was darkened  not by the sun  but by his inner 
thoughts  his glance was hard  but absent and as if lost  his eyes 
were clouded and there were whitish grey circles around the black 
pupils as m an ageing eagle  his big mouth  with scarcely per  
ceptible lips  was firmly set but moved slowly as if he were always 
turning over in his mind some word which he did not pronounce  

none the less  men left him with a feeling of comfort  neither 


    



calmed nor consoled  but touched and exalted by his firm and 
hopeless intransigence 

whenever shemsibeg went down to the market place on fridays  
he was met with some fresh change in men or buildings which 
had not been there the friday before in order not to have to 
look at it  he kept his eyes fixed on the ground but there  in the 
drying mud of the streets  he saw the marks of horses  hooves 
and noticed how alongside the broad rounded tuikish shoes the 
sharp pointed bent austrian horseshoes were becoming more and 
more common so that even there in the mud his gaze read the 
same merciless judgment that he read everywhere in men s faces 
and in the things about him  a judgment of time which would 
not be halted 

seeing that there was nowhere to rest his eyes  shemsibeg ceased 
altogether to come down into the market he withdrew completely 
to his crnje and sat theie  a sdent but strict and implacable master  
severe towards all but most of all towards himself  the oldest 
and most respected turks of the town continued to visit him there  
regarding him as a sort of living saint  amongst them  in particular  
alihodja   at last  in the third year of the occupation  shemsibeg 
died without ever having been ill he passed away without ever 
pronouncing that bitter word which was for ever on the tip 
of his old lips and never again setting foot m the market place  
where all men had set out on the new ways  

indeed the town changed rapidly in appearance  for the new  
comers cut down trees  planted new ones in other places  repaired 
the streets  cut new ones  dug drainage canals  built public buildings 
in the first few years they pulled down m the market place those 
old and dilapidated shops which were out of line and which  to 
tell the truth  had up till then inconvenienced no one in place 
of those old fashioned shops with their wooden drop counters  new 
ones were built  well sited  with tiled roofs and metal rollers on 
the doors   alihodja s shop too was destined to be a victim of 
these measures  but the hodja opposed it resolutely  took the affair 
to law  contested it and dragged it on in every possible way until 
at last he succeeded  and his shop remained just as it was and 
just where it was   the market place was levelled and widened  
a new konak was erected  a great building intended to house the 
law courts and the local administration  the army  too  was working 
on its own account  even more rapidly and inconsiderately than 
the civil authorities  they put up barracks  cleared waste land  
planted and changed the appearance of whole hills  

the older inhabitants could not understand  and wondered  just 

    



when they thought that all this incomprehensible energy had come 
to an end  the newcomers started some fresh and even more 
incomprehensible task  the townsmen stopped and looked at all 
this work  but not like children who love to watch the work of 
adults but as adults who stop for a moment to watch children s 
games  this continual need of the newcomers to build and rebuild  
to dig and to put back again  to put up and modify  this eternal 
desire of theirs to foresee the action of natural forces  to avoid 
or surmount them  no one either understood or appreciated  on 
the other hand all the townsmen  especially the older men  saw 
this unhealthy activity as a bad omen had it been left to them 
the town would have gone on looking as any other little oriental 
tovra  what burst would be patched up  what leant would be 
shored up  but beyond that no one would needlessly create work 
or make plans or interfere in the foimdations of buildings or 
change the aspect which god had given to the town  

but the newcomers went on with their tasks  one after the 
other  quickly and logically  according to unknown and well pre  
pared plans  to the even greater wonder and astonishment of the 
townsfolk  thus unexpectedly and quickly came the turn of the 
dilapidated and abandoned caravanserai  which was always re  
garded as an integral part of the bridge  even as it had been     
years before in fact what had been known as the stone han had 
long ago become completely ruined the doors had rotted  those 
lace like grilles of soft stone on the windows broken  the roof 
had fallen into the interior of the building and from it grew a 
great acacia and a welter of nameless shrubs and weeds  but the 
outer walls were still whole  a true and haimonious rectangle 
of stone still standing upnght  in the eyes of the townspeople  
from birth to death  this was no ordinary ruin but the completion 
of the bndge  as much an integral part of the town as their own 
houses  and no one would ever have dreamt that the old han could 
be touched or that it was necessary to change anything about it 
that time and nature had not already changed  

but one day its turn came too  first engineers who spent a long 
time measuring the ruins  then workmen and labourers who began 
to take it down stone by stone  frightening and driving away all 
sorts of birds and small beasts which had their nests there  rapidly 
the level space above the market place by the bridge became 
bald and empty and all that was left of the ban was a heap of 
good stone carefully piled  

a little more than a year later  instead of the former caravanserai 
of white stone  there rose a high  massive two storied barracks  


    



washed in pale blue  roofed with grey corrugated iron and with 
loopholes at the comers soldiers drilled all day on the open space 
and stretched their limbs or fell head first in the dust like suppliants 
to the loud shouts of the corporals in the evening the sound of 
incomprehensible soldiers  songs accompanied by an accordion 
could be heard from the many windows of the ugly building this 
went on until the penetrating sound of the bugle with its melancholy 
melody  which set all the dogs of the town howling  extinguished 
all these sounds together with the last lights in the windows so 
disappeared the lovely bequest of the vezir and so the barracks  
which the people true to ancient custom went on calling the 
stone han  commenced its life on the level by the bridge in complete 
lack of harmony with all that surrounded it  

the bridge now remained completely isolated 
to tell the truth  things were happening on the bridge too  
where the old unchanging customs of the people clashed with 
the innovations which the newcomers and their way of life 
brought with them  and in these clashes all that was old and 
local was always forced to give way and adapt itself 
as far as the local people were concerned  life on the kapia went 
its way as of old only it was noticed that now serbs and jews 
came more freely and in greater numbers to the kapia and at all 
times of day  paying no heed as they once had done to the habits 
and privileges of the turks otherwise all went on as before  in 
the daytime merchants sat there waiting for the peasant woman 
and buying from them wool  poultry and eggs  and beside them 
the lazy and idle who moved from one part of the town to another 
in keeping with the movements of the sun  towards evening other 
citizens began to arrive and the merchants and workers gathered 
there to talk a little or to remain silent for a time looking at the great 
green river bordered by dwarf willows and sandbanks  the night 
was for the young  they had never known  nor did they know 
now  any limits for the time that they stayed on the bridge nor 
for what they did there  

in that night time life of the kapia there were  at least at first  
changes and misunderstandings  the new authorities had introduced 
permanent lighting in the town  in the first years of the occupation 
they put lanterns on green standards  in which petrol lamps burned  
m the main streets and at the crossroads  the lanterns were cleaned  
filled and lit by big ferhat  a poor devil with a house full of 
children  who until then had been a servant in the municipality  
he discharged the petards announcing ramazan and carried out 
similar jobs  without any fixed or certain wages the bridge too 



was lighted at several points  including the kapia  the standard 
for this lantern was fixed to that oak beam which was all that 
remained of the former blockhouse  this lantern on the kapia had 
to endure a long struggle with the local jokers  with those who 
loved to sing in the darkness or to smoke and chat on the kapia 
as also with the destructive impulses of the young men in whom 
love yearning  solitude and plum brandy mingled and clashed  that 
flickering light irritated them and so cotmtless times both the 
lantern and the lamp inside were smashed to pieces there were 
many fines and sentences because of that lantern  at one time a 
special police agent was told to keep an eye on the light so the 
nightly visitors now had a living witness  even more unpleasant 
than the lantern  but time exercised its influence and the new 
generation grew accustomed to it and so reconciled to its existence 
that they gave free vent to their night feelings under the weak 
light of the municipal lantern  and no longer threw at it whatever 
came to hand  sticks  stones or anything else  this reconaliation 
was made so much the easier because on moonlit nights  when the 
kapia was most visited  the lantern was generally not lit  

only once a year the bridge had to experience a great illumination  
on the eve of august i th every year  the emperor s birthday  
the authorities decorated the bridge with garlands and lines of 
young pine trees and  as darkness fell  lit strings of lanterns and 
fairy lights  hundreds of army ration tins  filled with lard and fat  
flamed in long rows along the parapet of the bridge  they lit up 
the centre of the bridge  leaving the ends and the piers lost m the 
darkness  so that the illuminated part seemea as if floating in 
space but every light quickly bums out and every feast comes to 
an end  by the next day the bridge was once again what it had 
always been  only in the eyes of some of the children there 
remained a new and unusual picture of the bridge under the short  
lived play of light  a bright and striking vision  but short and 
transient as a dream  

besides permanent lighting  the new authorities also introduced 
cleanliness on the kapia  or more exactly that special sort of 
cleanliness that accorded with their ideas  the fmit peelings  melon 
seeds and nutshells no longer remained for days on the flagstones 
until the rain or the wind carried them away  now a municipal 
sweeper brushed them up every morning but that irritated no one  
for men quickly become accustomed to cleanliness even when it 
forms no part of their needs or habits  naturally on condition 
that they personally do not have to observe it  

there was still one more novelty which the occupation and 



the newcomers brought with them  women began to come to the 
kapia for the fitst time m its existence the wives and daughters 
of the officials  their nursemaids and servants would stop there 
to chat or come to sit there on holidays woth their military or 
civil escorts this did not happen very often  but none the less 
it was enough to distuib the older men who came there to smoke 
their pipes in peace and quiet over the water  and disconcerted 
and confused the younger ones  

there had  naturally  always been a link between the kapia and 
the women in the tow n  but only in so far as the menfolk gathered 
there to pass compliments to the girls crossing the bridge or to 
express their joys  pains and quarrels over women and find relief 
from them on the kapia many a lonely man would sit for hours 
or even days singing softly to himself  for my soul only   or 
wreathed in tobacco smoke  or simply watching the swift waters 
in silence  paying tribute to that exaltation to which we must 
all pay due and from which few escape  many a contest between 
rivals was settled there  many love intrigues imagined much was 
said or thought about w omen and about love  many passions 
were born and many extinguished  all this there was  but women 
had never stopped or sat on the kapia  neither christian nor  still 
less  moslem now all that was changed  

now on sundays and holidays on the kapia could be seen cooks 
tightly laced and red in the face  with rolls of fat overflowing 
above and below their corsets in which they could scarcely breathe  
with them were their sergeants in well brushed uniforms  with 
shining metal buttons and riflemen s pompoms on their chests 
and on working days at dusk  officers and civil servants strolled 
there with their wives  halted on the kapia  chatted in their m  
comprehensible language  strolled about at their ease and laughed 
loudly  

these idle  laughing women were a cause of scandal to all  
some more some less  the people wondered and felt insulted for 
a time and then began to grow accustomed to them  as they had 
grown accustomed to so many other innovations  even though 
they did not approve them  

in fact it could be said that all these changes on the bridge 
were insignificant  fleeting and superficial  the many and important 
changes which had taken place in the spirits and habits of the 
citizens and in the outward appearance of the town seemed as 
though they had passed by the bridge without affecting it  it 
seemed that the white and ancient bridge  across which men had 
passed for three centuries  remained unchanged without trace or 



mark even under the  new emperor  and that it would triumph 
over this flood of change and innovation even as it had always 
triumphed over the greatest floods  arising once more  white and 
untouched  from the furious mass of troubled waters which had 
wanted to flow over it  


    



xii 




n ow life on the kapia became even livelier and more varied  

a large and variegated crowd  locals and newcomers  old 
and young  came and went on the kapia all day long until 
a late hour of the night  they thought only of themselves  
each one wrapped up in the thoughts  moods and emotions which 
had brought him to the kapia  therefore they paid no heed to the 
passers by who  impelled by other thoughts and by their own cares  
crossed the bridge with lowered heads or absent glances  looking 
neither to right nor left and paying no attention to those seated on 
the kapia  

among such passers by one was certainly milan glasl anin of 
okoliste  he was tall  thin  pale and bowed  his whole body seemed 
transparent and without weight  yet attached to leaden feet  so that 
he swayed and bent in his walk like a church banner held in a child s 
hands during the procession  his hair and moustaches were grey  
like those of an old man  and his eyes were always lowered  he did 
not notice that anything had changed on the kapia or among the 
people gathered there  and passed among them almost unnoticed by 
those who came there to sit  to dream  to sing  to trade  to chat or 
simply to waste time  the older men had forgotten him  the younger 
men did not recall him and the newcomers had never known him  
but none the less his fate had been closely bound up with the kapia  
at least judging from what was said about him or whispered in the 
town ten or twelve years before  

milan s father  nikola glasicanin  had settled in the town about 
the time when the insurrection in serbia was at its height  he had 
bought a fine property at okoliste  it was generally believed that he 
had fled from somewhere or other with a large but ill gotten fortune  
no one had any proof of this and everyone only half believed it  but 
no one ever definitely denied it  he had married twice but none the 
less had few children  he had brought up one child only  his son 
milan  and left him all that he possessed  whether open or hidden  
milan  too  had only a single son  peter  his property would have 


    



been sufficient and he would have left that to his son after his death 
had he not had one vice  only one  but that an overwhelming passion 
 gambling  

the real townsmen were not gamblers by nature  as we have seen  
their passions were other and different  an immoderate love of 
women  an inclmation to alcohol  song  lounging and idle dreamings 
beside their native river  but man s capacities are limited  even in 
such matters therefore their vices often clashed with one another  
contradicted one another and often completely cancelled one 
another out  this did not mean that in the town there were not men 
addicted to this vice  but the actual number of gamblers was always 
few in comparison with other tovras  and for the most part they 
were strangers or newcomers  anyhow  milan glasicanin was one 
of them  from his earliest youth he had been entirely given over to 
gambling when he could not find the company he needed in the 
town  he would go to nearby districts whence he would return  either 
weighed down with money like a merchant from a fair or with 
empty pockets  without watch or chain  tobacco pouch or rings  but 
always pale and washed out like a sick man  

his habitual place was in ustamujid s inn at the far end of the 
vijegrad market  there  m a narrow windowless room where a 
candle burned day and night  could always be found three or four 
men to whom gambling was dearer than anything else on earth  in 
that room  shut off from the world  they would aouch in the tobacco 
smoke and stale air  with bloodshot eyes  dry mouths and quivering 
hands  they met there frequently  day or night  slaves to their 
passion like martyrs  in that little room milan passed a great part 
of his youth and there left a good part of his strength and pro  
perty  

he had not been much more than thirty when that sudden and to 
most people mexplicable change took place in him  which cured him 
for ever of his driving passion but at the same time altered his whole 
way of life and completely transfigured him  

one autumn  some fourteen years before  a stranger had come to 
the inn  he was neither young nor old  neither ugly nor handsome  
a man of middle age and medium height  silent and smiling only wdth 
his eyes  he was a man of business  entirely wrapped up in the affairs 
for which he had come  he passed the night there and at dusk entered 
that little room in which the gamblers had been shut up since early 
afternoon  they greeted him with distrust but he behaved so quietly 
and meekly that they did not even notice when he too began to put 
small stakes on the cards  he lost more than he won  frowned un  
certainly and with an unsure hand took some silver money from an 


    



inner pocket after he had lost a considerable sum  they had to give 
him the deal at first he dealt slow ly and carefully  then more swiftly 
and freely he played without showing his feelings but was prepared 
to stake the limit  the pile of silver coins before him grew one by 
one  the players began to drop out  one offered to stake a gold chain 
on a caid  but the newcomer refused coldly  saying that he played 
for money only 

about the time of the last prayei the game broke up  for no one 
had any ready money left milan glasi anin was the last  but in the 
end he too had to w ithdraw  the newcomer politely took his leave 
and retired to his own room 

next day they played again again the stranger alternately lost 
and won  but always won more than he lost  so that once again the 
townsmen were left without ready money they looked at his hands 
and his sleeves  watched him from every angle  brought fresh cards 
and changed places at the table  but all to no purpose  they were 
playing that simple but ill famed game called otuz bir  thirty one  
which they had all known from childhood  but none the less they 
were not able to follow the newcomer s mode of play sometimes 
he drew twenty mne and sometimes thirty  and sometimes he stood 
pat at twenty five he accepted every stake  the smallest as well as 
the greatest  overlooked the petty irregularities of individual players 
as if he had not noticed them  but denounced more serious ones 
curtly and coldly 

the presence of this newcomer at the inn tormented and irritated 
milan glasi anm he was in any case at that time feverish and 
washed out  he swore to himself that he would play no more  but 
came again  and again lost his last com  returning home filled with 
gall and shame  the fourth and fifth evenings he managed to con  
trol himself and remained at home  he had dressed and prepared his 
ready money but none the less stood by his resolution  his head felt 
heavy and his breath came in fits and starts  he ate his supper in 
haste  scarcely knowing what he was eating finally he went out  
smoked  walked up and down in front of his house several times  
and looked at the silent town in the clear autumn night  after he 
had walked thus for some time  he suddenly saw a vague figure going 
along the road who turned and stopped before his house  

 good evening  neighbour   shouted the unknown  milan knew 
the voice  it was the stranger from the inn  clearly the man had 
come to see him and wanted to talk to him  milan came up to the 
fence  

 why didn t you come to the inn tonight   the stranger asked 
casually  calm and indifferent  


    



 i was not in the mood today  are the others there   

there is no one left  they all left earlier than usual  come along 
and let s have a hand together   

 it is too late  and there s nowhere to go   

 let us go down and sit on the kapia  the moon will soon be rising  
 but it is not the right time   milan objected  his lips were dry 
and his words seemed as if another had spoken them  

the stranger went on waiting  certain that his suggestion would 
be accepted  

and  in fact  milan unlatched his gate and followed the man  as 
though his words and thoughts and efforts had all given way before 
that calm power which drew him on and from which he could not 
free himself  however much he felt humiliated by this stranger who 
roused in him resistance and revulsion  

they descended the slope from okoliste quickly  a large and wax  
ing moon was rising behind stani evac  the bridge seemed endless 
and unreal  for its ends were lost in a milky mist and the piers merged 
into the darkness  one side of each pier and of each arch was brightly 
lit while the other remained in the deepest shadow  these moonlit 
and darkened surfaces were broken and cut into sharp outlines  so 
that the whole bridge seemed like a strange arabesque created by a 
momentary play of light and darkness 
on the kapia there was not a living soul  they sat down  the 
stranger took out a pack of cards  milan started to say how unsuit  
able this was  that they could not see the cards well and could not 
distinguish the money  but the stranger paid no attention to him  
they began to play  

at first they still exchanged an occasional word  but as the game 
grew faster they fell silent  they only rolled cigarettes and lit them 
one after the other  the cards changed hands several times  only to 
remain finally in the hands of the stranger  the money fell sound  
lessly on the stones which were covered by a fine dew  the time had 
come  which milan knew so well  when the stranger drew a two to 
twenty nine or an ace to thirty  his throat contracted and his gaze 
clouded  but the face of the stranger  bathed in moonlight  seemed 
calmer than usual  in not quite an hour milan no longer had any 
ready money  the stranger proposed that he should go home and get 
some more and said that he would accompany him  they went there 
and returned and went on with the game  milan played as if dumb 
and blind  guessing at the cards and showing by signs what he 
wanted  it almost seemed as if the cards between them had become 
incidental  a pretext in this desperate and unrelenting duel  when 
he again ran out of money  the stranger ordered him to go home and 


    



bring some more  while he himselt remained on the kapia smoking  
he no longer thought it necessary to accompany him  for he could 
no longer imagine that milan would not obey  or play a trick on him 
and remain at home milan obeyed  went without argument and re  
turned humbly then the luck suddenly changed milan won back 
all that he had lost  the knot in his throat tightened more and more 
under the stress of emotion the stranger began to double the stakes 
and then to treble them  the game grew more and more swift  more 
and more intense the cards flew between them weaving a web of 
gold and silver  both were silent  only milan breathed excitedly  
sweating and feeling chilled alternately in the mild moonlit night 
he played  dealt and covered his cards  not from the pleasure of the 
game but because he had to  it seemed to him that this stranger 
wanted to draw out of him not only all his money  ducat by ducat  
but also the marrow from his bones and the blood from his veins  
drop by drop  and that his strength and his will power were leaving 
him with every new loss in the game from time to time he stole a 
glance at his opponent he expected to see a satanic face with bared 
teeth and eyes like red hot coals  but on the contrary he still saw 
before him the stranger s ordinary face with the intent expression of 
a man working at an everyday task  hastening to finish the work in 
hand which was neither easy nor pleasant  

once more milan rapidly lost all his ready money then the 
stranger proposed staking cattle  land and property 

 i wager four good hungarian ducats against your bay with its 
saddle  is it a deal   

 i agree   

so the bay went  and after it two packhorses  then cows and 
calves  like a careful and meticulous merchant  the stranger num  
bered all the beasts in milan s stables by name and set down 
accurately the value of each head  as if he had been born and reared 
in the house  

 here are thirteen ducats for that field of yours you call salkusha 
have i your word   

tou have   

the stranger dealt  milan s five cards totalled twenty eight  

 more   asked the stranger calmly  

 one   muttered milan in a scarcely audible voice and all his blood 
rushed to his heart  

the stranger slowly turned a card  it was a two  a lucky draw 
milan muttered indifferently through closed teeth  

 enough   

he closed his cards  concealing them feverishly  he tried to make 

    



his voice and expression indifferent  to prevent his opponent from 
guessing how he stood  

then the stranger began to draw for himself  with open cards  
when he got to twenty seven he stopped and looked milan in the 
eyes  but milan looked away  the stranger turned another card  it 
was a two he sighed quickly  scarcely audibly  it seemed that he 
would stand pat at twenty nine and the blood began to flow back to 
milan s head in a joyful presentiment of victory  then the stranger 
started  expanded his chest and threw back his head so that his eyes 
and forehead shone in the moonlight and turned up another card  
another two  it seemed impossible that three twos should turn up 
one after the other  but so it was on the turned up card milan 
seemed to see his field  ploughed and harrowed as it was in spring 
when it was at its best the furrows whirled about him as in delirium  
but the calm voice of the stranger recalled him to himself  

 otuz mr  the field is mine   

then came the turn of the other fields  then both houses and then 
the oak grove at osojnica  they invariably agreed on the values  
sometimes milan would win and would snatch up the ducats  hope 
shone before him like gold but after two or three unlucky hands he 
was again without money and again began staking his property  

when the game had swept away everything like a torrent both 
players stopped for a moment  not to take breath for both of them it 
seemed feared to do so  but to consider what else they could wager 
the stranger was calm like a conscientious worker who has finished 
the first part of his task and wants to hasten on with the second 
milan remained tense as if turned to ice  his blood was beating in his 
ears and the stone seat beneath him rose and fell  then the stranger 
suggested in that monotonous  even  somewhat nasal voice  

 do you know what  friend  let us have one more turn at the 
cards  but all for all  i will wager all that i have gained tonight and 
you your life  if you win  everything will be yours again just as it 
was  money  cattle and lands  if you lose  you will leap from the 
kapia into the drina   

he said this in the same dry and business like voice as he had said 
everything else  as if it were a question of the most ordinary wager 
between two gamblers absorbed by their play  

so it has come to losing my soul or saving it  thought milan and 
made an effort to rise  to extricate himself from that incomprehen  
sible whirlpool that had taken everything from him and even now 
drew him on with irresistible force  but the stranger sent him back 
to his place with a glance  as if they had been playing at the inn for 
a stake of three or four grosh he lowered his head and held out his 


    



hand they both cut the stranger cut a four and milan a ten  it was 
his turn to deal and that filled him vsith hope he dealt and the 
stranger asked for a complete new hand 

 more  more  more   

the man took f  e cards and only then said  enough   now it was 
milan s turn when he i cached tw enty eight he stopped for a second  
looked at the cards m the stranger s hand and at his enigmatic face  
he w as unable to get any idea at how  many the stranger had stopped  
but it was exceedingly likely that he had more than twenty eight  
firstly  because ail e cning he had ne er stopped at low scores and 
secondly  becviuse he had five cards summoning the last of his 
strength milan turned over one more card it was a four  that meant 
thirty two he had lost 

he looked at the card but was unable to believe his eyes it seemed 
to him impossible that he should have lost everything so quickly  
something fiery and noisy seemed to course through him  from his 
feet to his head suddenly everything became clear  the value of life  
what it meant to be a man and the meaning of his curse  that inex  
plicable passion to gamble ivith friends or strangers  with himself 
and with all around him  all was clear and light as if the day had 
dawned and he had only been dreaming that he had gambled and 
lost  but everything was at the same time tiue  irrevocable and irre  
parable  he wanted to make some sound  to groan  to cry out for 
help  even were it only a sigh  but he could not summon up enough 
strength  

before him the stranger stood waiting 

then  all of a sudden  a cock crowed somewhere on the bank  high 
and clear  and immediately after  a second it was so near that he 
could hear the beating of its wings at the same time the scattered 
cards flew away as if carried off by a stoi m  the money was scattered 
and the whole kapia rocked to its foundations  milan closed his eyes 
in fear and thought that his last hour had come  when he opened 
them again he saw that he was alone  his opponent had vanished 
like a soap bubble and with him the cards and the money from the 
stone flags  

an orange coloured moon swam on the horizon  a fresh breeze 
began to blow  the roar of waters in the depths became louder  
milan tentatively fingered the stone on which he was sitting  trying 
to collect himself  to remember where he was and what had hap  
pened  then he rose heavily and as if on someone else s legs moved 
slowly homeward to okoliste  

groaning and staggering he scarcely reached the door of his house 
before he fell like a wounded man  striking the door heavily with his 



body those in the house  wakened by the noise  carried him to bed  

for two months he lay in fever and delirium  it was thought that 
he would not survive  pop nikola came and consecrated the holy 
oils none the less he recovered and got up again  but as a different 
man  he was now a man old before his time  an eccentric who lived 
in a world apart  who spoke little and associated with other men 
as little as possible  on his face  which never smiled  was an expres  
sion of painful and concentrated attention  he concerned himself 
only with his own house and went about his own business  as if he 
had never heard of company or of cards  

during his illness he had told pop nikola all that had happened 
that night on the kapia  and later he told it all to two good friends of 
his  for he felt that he could not go on living with that secret on his 
mind  the people heard the rumours of what had happened but  as 
if what had actually happened had been a small matter  they added 
further details and elaborated the whole story  and then  as is usually 
the case  turned their attention elsewhere and forgot all about milan 
and his experience  so what was left of the one time milan glasisanin 
lived  worked and moved among the townsfolk  the younger genera  
tion only knew him as he was in their time and never suspected that 
he had been different  and he himself seemed to have forgotten 
everything when  descending from his house to the town  he crossed 
the bridge with his heavy slow sleepwalker s step  he passed by the 
kapia without the least emotion  even without any memory of it  it 
never even crossed his mind that that sofa with its white stone seats 
and carefree crowd could have any connection with that terrible 
place  somewhere at the ends of the earth  where he had one night 
played his last game  staking on a deceiving card all that he pos  
sessed  even his own life in this world and the next  

often milan asked himself if all that night episode on the kapia 
had been only a dream which he had dreamt as he lay unconscious 
before the door of his house  the consequence and not the cause of 
his illness  to tell the truth  both pop nikola and those two friends in 
whom he had confided were more inclined to regard the whole of 
milan s tale as a hallucination  a fantasy which had appeared to him 
in a fever  for none of them believed that the devil played otuz bit 
or that he would take anyone he wished to destroy to the kapia but 
our experiences are often so heavy and clouded that it is no wonder 
that men justify themselves by the intervention of satan himself  
considering that this explains them or at least makes them more 
bearable  

but whether true or not  with the devil s help or without it  in 
dream or in fact  it was sure that milan glasifanin  since he had lost 



his health and his youth and a large sum of money overnight  had 
by a miracle been finally liberated for ever from his vice  and not 
only that  to the story of milan glasifanin was added yet another 
tale of yet another destiny  whose thread started also from the kapia 
the day after the night when milan glasiianm  in dream or in 
waking  had played his terrible final game on the kapia dawned a 
sunny autumn day  it was a saturday  as always on saturdays  the 
visegrad jews  merchants with their male children  were gathered 
on the kapia  at leisure and in formal dress  with satin trousers and 
woollen waistcoats  with dull red shallow fezzes on their heads  they 
strictly observed the sabbath day  walking beside the river as if look  
ing for someone in it  but for the most part they sat on the kapia  
carrying on loud and lively conversations in spanish  only usmg 
serbian when they wanted to swear 
among the first to arrive on the kapia that morning was bukus 
gaon  the eldest son of the pious  poor and honest barber  avram 
gaon  he was sixteen and still had not found permanent work or a 
regular occupation  the young man  unlike all the other gaons  was 
somewhat scatter brained and this had prevented him from behaving 
reasonably and settling down to a trade  and drove him to look for 
something higher and better for himself  when he wanted to sit 
down  he looked to see if the seat was clean  it was while doing this 
that he saw  in a crack between two stones  a thin line of shining 
yellow  that was the shine of gold  so dear to men s eyes  he looked 
more closely  there could be no doubt  a ducat had somehow fallen 
there  the young man looked around him  to see if anyone was 
watching  and searched for something to pry loose the ducat which 
laughed at him from its hiding place  then suddenly he remembered 
that it was a saturday and that it would be a shame and a sin to do 
any kind of work  excited and embarrassed  he went on sitting on 
that spot and did not move until noon  when it was time for lunch 
and all the jews  old and young  had gone home  he found a thick 
barley stalk and  forgetting the sm and the holy day  carefully pried 
the ducat loose from between the stones  it was a real hungarian 
ducat  thin and weighing no more than a dead leaf  he was late for 
lunch  when he sat down at the sparse table around which all thir  
teen of them  eleven children  father and mother  were sitting  he 
did not hear how his father scolded him and called him a lazy 
wastrel who could not even be in time for lunch  his ears hummed 
and his eyes were dazzled  before him opened those days of unheard  
of luxury of which he had often dreamed  it seemed to him that he 
was carrying the sun in his pocket  


    



next day  without much reflection  bukus went to ustamujid s inn 
and edged his way into that little room where at almost any time 
of the day or night the cards were in play he had always dreamed 
of doing this  but had never had enough money to dare to go in and 
try his luck  now he was able to realize that dream  

there he passed several hours filled with anguish and emotion  at 
first they had all greeted him with disdain and mistrust  when they 
saw him change the hungarian ducat they at once thought that he 
had stolen it from someone but they agreed to accept him and his 
stake  for if gamblers questioned the origin of every stake  the game 
would never begin   but then fresh miseries commenced for the be  
ginner  whenever he won  the blood rushed to his head and his eyes 
clouded with sweat and heat  when he made a rather greater loss it 
seemed to him that he stopped breathing and his heart died  but de  
spite all his torments  each of which seemed insoluble  he none the 
less left the inn that evening with four ducats in his pocket  though 
he was broken and feverish with emotion as if he had been beaten 
with fiery rods  he walked proud and erect  before his glowing imagi  
nation opened far and glorious prospects which threw a glittering 
sheen over his poverty and swept away the whole town down to its 
foundations  he walked with a solemn pace as though drunk  for the 
first time in his life he was able to feel not only the shimmer and the 
sound of gold but also its weight  

that same autumn  though still young and green  bukus became a 
gambler and a vagabond and left the family home  old gaon 
shrivelled up from shame and grief for his eldest son  and the whole 
jewish community felt the misfortune as if it had been its own  later 
he left the town and went out into the world with his evil gambler s 
destiny  and nothing more was ever heard of him for all those four  
teen years  the cause of all that  they said  was that  devivs ducat  
which he had found on the kapia and had pried loose on the sabbath 
day  



xiii 




i t was the fourth year of the occupation  it seemed as if every  
thing had somehow or other calmed down and  was working  
even if the sweet peace of turkish times had not been restored  
at least order had been established according to the new ideas 
but then there were once more troubles in the land  fresh troops 
arrived unexpectedly and a guard was once again mounted on 
the kapia  this was the way of it  

the new authorities that year began recruiting m bosnia and 
herzegovina this piovoked great agitation among the people  
especially the turks  fifty years before  when the sultan had intro  
duced the nizam  the first turkish regular army   clothed  drilled 
and equipped in the european manner  they had revolted and waged 
a series of small but bloody wars  for they would not wear the 
infidel clothing and put on belts which crossed over the chest and 
so created the hated symbol of the cioss now they had to put on 
that same odious  tight clothing  and that  furthermore  in the 
service of a foreign ruler of another faith  

in the first years after the occupation  when the authorities had 
begun numbering houses and taking a census of the population  
these measures had already excited mistrust among the turks and 
stirred up undefined but deeply felt misgivings  

as always in such cases  the most learned and respected of the 
visegrad turks met stealthily to discuss the significance of these 
measures and the attitude they should adopt towards them  

one may morning these leaders gathered on the kapia as if by 
chance and occupied all the seats on the soia peacefully drinking 
their coffee and looking straight in front of them  they talked in 
whispers of the new and suspicious measures of the authorities 
they were all ill at ease about the new ideas  the very nature 
of which was contrary to their ideas and habits  for each of them 
considered this interference by the authorities in his personal affairs 
and his family life as an unnecessary and incomprehensible humilia  
tion  but no one knew how to interpret the real sense of this 


    



numbering  nor could suggest how it could best be resisted  amongst 
them was alihodja who otherwise rarely came to the kapia  for 
his right ear always throbbed painfully when he happened to 
look at those stone steps leading up to the sola  

the visegrad schoolmaster  husseinaga  a learned and loquacious 
man  interpreted  as the most competent amongst them to do so  
what this noting down of houses by number and this counting of 
men and children might mean  

 this has  it seems  always been an infidel custom  thirty years 
ago  if not more  there was a vezir in travnik  a certain tahirpasha 
stambolija  he was one of the converted  but false and insincere  
he remained a christian in his soul  as he had once been he kept  
it is said  a bell beside him and when he wanted to call one of his 
servants he would nng this bell like a christian priest until someone 
answered it was this tahirpasha who began to number the houses 
in travnik and on each house he nailed a tablet with the number 
 it was for this reason that he was known as  the nailer    but 
the people rebelled and collected all those tablets from the houses  
made a pile of them and set fire to it  blood was about to flow for 
this  but luckily a report of this reached stambul and he was recalled 
from bosnia may all trace of him be abolished  now this is some  
thing of the same sort  the schwabes want to have registers of 
everything  even our heads   

they all stared straight in front of them and listened to the 
schoolmaster who was well known to prefer recounting long and 
detailed stories of the past to giving his own opinion shortly and 
clearly on what was taking place in the present  

as always  alihodja was the first to lose patience  

this does not concern the schwabes  faith  muderis effendi  it 
concerns their interests  they are not playing and do not waste 
their time even when they are sleeping but look well to their own 
affairs  we cannot see today what all this means  but we shall 
see it in a month or two  or perhaps a year  for  as the late lamented 
shemsibeg brankovid used to say   the schwabes  mines have long 
fuses   this numbering of houses and men  or so i see it  is necessary 
for them because of some new tax  or else they are thinking of 
getting men for forced labour or for their army  or perhaps both  
if you ask me what we should do  this is my opinion  we have 
not got the army to rise at once in revolt  that god sees and 
all men know  but we do not have to obey all that we are com  
manded  no one need remember his number nor tell his age  let 
them guess when each one of us was bom  if they go too far and 
interfere with our children and our honour  then we shall not 



give way but will defend ourselves  and then let it be as god 
wills   

they went on discussing the unpalatable measures of the 
authonties for a long time  but in the mam they were in agreement 
with what alihodja had recommended  passive resistance  men 
concealed their ages or gave false information  making the excuse 
that they were illiterate and as for women no one even dared 
to ask about them  for that would have been considered a deadly 
insult  despite all the instructions and threats of the authorities 
the tablets with the house numbers were nailed upside down or 
hidden away in places where they were invisible  or else they 
immediately whitewashed their houses and  as if by chance  the 
house number was whitewashed too  

seeing that the resistance was deep seated and sincere  though 
concealed  the authorities turned a blind eye  avoiding any strict 
application of the laws with all the consequences and disputes 
which would inevitably have ensued  

two years passed the agitation about the census had been for  
gotten when the recruitment of young men  irrespective of faith 
and class  was actually put into force  open rebellion broke out 
in eastern herzegovina  in which not only turks but also serbs 
took part  the leaders of the rebels tried to establish ties with 
foreign countries  especially with turkey  and claimed that the 
occupation authorities had gone beyond the powers granted them 
at the berlin congress and that they had no right to recruit in 
the occupied districts which still remained under nominal turkish 
suzerainty in bosnia there was no organized resistance  but the 
revolt spread by way of fo a and gora da to the borders of the 
visegrad district individual msurgents or the remnants of routed 
bands tried to seek refuge in the sanjak or in serbia  crossing the 
bridge at viiegrad  as always in such circumstances  in addition 
to the rebellion  banditry began to flourish  

so once more  after so many years  a guard was mounted on 
the kapia  though it was winter and heavy snow had fallen  two 
gendarmes kept watch on the kapia day and night  they stopped all 
unknown or suspected persons crossing the bridge  interrogated 
them and inspected their belongings  

a fortnight later a detachment of streifkorps appeared in the 
town and relieved the gendarmes on the kapia  the streiikorps 
had been organized when the rebellion in herzegovina had begun 
to assume serious proportions  they were mobile storm troops  
picked men equipped for action in diflicult terrain  and made up 
of well paid volunteers  amongst them were men who had 

    



responded to the first call up with the occupation troops and did 
not want to return to their homes  but remained to serve in the 
streiikorps  others had been seconded from the gendamaerie to 
the new mobile units  finally  there were also a certain number of 
local inhabitants who served as informers and guides  

throughout that winter  which was neither short nor mild  a 
guard of two streiikorps men kept watch on the bridge  usually 
the guard consisted of one stranger and one local man  they did 
not build a blockhouse  as the turks had done during the karageorge 
insurrection in serbia there was no killing or cutting off of heads  
but none the less this time  as always when the kapia was 
closed  there were unusual events which left their trace on the 
town  for hard times cannot pass without misfortune for some  
one  

among the streiikorps men who mounted guard on the kapia was 
a young man  gregor fedun  a ruthenian from eastern galicia  this 
young man was then in his twenty third year  of gigantic stature but 
childlike mind  strong as a bear but modest as a girl  he had almost 
completed his military service when his regiment was sent to bosnia  
he had taken part in fighting at magla  and on the glasinac moun  
tains and had then spent eighteen months on garrison duty in eastern 
bosnia when his time was up  he had not wanted to go back to his 
galician town of kolomea and to his father s house which was rich 
m children but in little else  he was in pest with his group when the 
call for volunteers to enrol m the streiikorps was made  as a soldier 
who knew bosnia through several months of fighting  fedun was 
accepted at once  he was sincerely glad at the thought that he was 
again to see the bosnian townships and hamlets where he had spent 
both hard and pleasant days  of which his memory recalled the days 
of hardship as more beautiful and lively even than the pleasant ones 
he melted with joy and was filled with pride  imagining the faces of 
his parents  brothers and sisters when they received the first silver 
fiorins which he would send them from his ample streiikorps pay  
above all he had the good fortune not to be sent into eastern herze  
govina where the fighting with the insurgents was tiring and often 
very dangerous  but to the town on the dnna where his duties con  
sisted of patrolling and guard keeping  

there he spent the winter  stamping his feet and blowing on his 
fingers on the kapia in the clear frosty nights  when the stones 
cracked in the frost and the sky paled above the town so that the 
large autumn stars became tiny  wicked little candles there he 
awaited the spring and watched its first signs on the kapia  that dull  
heavy booming of the ice on the dnna which a man feels deep down 


    



in his enti ails  and that sullen soughing of some new wind which has 
howled all night through the naked forests on the mountains close 
pressed above the bridge  

the young man mounted guard in his turn and felt how the spring  
with all its signs on the earth and on the waters  was slowly entering 
into him also  flooding his whole being and troubling his senses and 
his thoughts  he kept watch and hummed all the ruthenian songs 
which were sung in his own country  as he sang it seemed to him  
more and more every spring day  as if he were waiting for someone 
on that exposed and windy spot  

at the beginning of march  headquarters sent an order to the de  
tachment guarding the bridge to double their precautions since  
according to reliable information  the notorious brigand jakov 
cekrlija had crossed from herzegovina into bosnia and was now 
hiding somewhere near visegrad whence  in all likelihood  he would 
try to reach either the serbian or the turkish frontier  the streifkorps 
men on guard were given a personal description of him  with the 
comment that the brigand  though physically small and insignificant  
was very strong  daring and exceptionally cunning  and had already 
several times succeeded in escaping and outwitting the patrols that 
had surrounded him  

fedun had listened to this warning when making his report  and 
had taken it seriously as he did all official communications but he 
had considered it to be unnecessarily exaggerated  since he could not 
imagine how anyone could cross unperceived that ten paces which 
constituted the width of the bridge  calm and unworried he passed 
several hours  by day and by night  on the kapia  his attention was 
indeed doubled  but it was not taken up with the appearance of 
jakov  of whom there was neither sight nor sound  but with those 
countless signs and portents by which spring announced its arrival 
on the kapia  

it is not easy to concentrate all one s attention on a single object 
when one is twenty three years old  when one s body is quivering 
with strength and life and when around one  on all sides  spring is 
burgeoning  shining and filling the air with perfume the snow was 
melting in the ravines  the river ran swift and grey as smoked glass  
the wind which blew from the north east brought the breath of snow 
from the mountains and the first buds to the valleys  all this intoxi  
cated and distracted fedun as he paced out the space from one ter  
race to the other or  when on night duty  leant against the parapet 
and hummed his ruthenian songs to the accompaniment of the wind  
by day or by night the feeling that he was waiting for someone never 
left him  a feeling tormenting and yet sweet  and which seemed to 

    



find confirmation in all that was taking place around him  in the 
waters  the earth and the sky  

one day about lunchtime a turkish girl passed the guard  she was 
of the age when turkish girls  not yet veiled in the heavy feridjab  
no longer go with uncovered faces but wrap themselves in a large 
thin shawl which conceals the whole body  the hair and the hands  
chin and forehead  but still leaves uncovered a part of the face  eyes  
nose  mouth and cheeks she was in that short phase between child  
hood and womanhood when the moslem girls show innocently and 
gaily their still childish and yet womanly features which  perhaps 
even the next day  will be covered forever by the feridjah  

there was not a living soul on the kapia  fedun s fellow guard was 
a certain stevan of praca  one of the peasants attached to the streii  
korps he was a man of a certain age  by no means averse to plum 
brandy  who sat drowsing  contrary to regulations  on the stone sofa  

fedun looked at the girl timidly and cautiously around her 
floated her gaily coloured shawl  waving and shimmering in the sun  
light as if alive  moving with the gusts of wind and in rhythm with 
the girps pace  her calm lovely face was closely and tightly framed 
by the stretched weave of the shawl  her eyes were downcast but 
flickering  so she passed before him and disappeared across the bridge 
into the market  

the young man paced more briskly from one terrace to the other 
and kept an eye fixed on the market place  now it seemed to him 
that he really had someone for whom to wait  after half an hour  
the noonday lull was still unbroken on the bridge  the turkish girl 
returned from the market and again crossed before the troubled 
youth this time he looked at her a little longer and more boldly  and 
what was even more wonderful she too looked at him  a short but 
candid glance  with a sort of half smile  almost cunningly but with 
that innocent cunning with which children get the better of one 
another at their games  then she swayed away again  moving slowly 
but none the less vanishing quickly from his sight  with a thousand 
bends and movements of the wide shawl wrapped about her young 
but sturdy figure  the oriental design and lively colours of that shawl 
could long be seen between the houses on the farther bank  

only then did the young man wake from his reverie  he stood in 
the same place and in the same position as he had been at the moment 
when she had passed before him  with a start he fingered his rifle and 
looked around him with the sensation of a man who has let slip his 
opportunity  stevan was still dozing in the deceptive march sun  it 
seemed to the young man that both of them had in some way failed 
in their duty and that a whole army platoon could have passed by 

    



them without him bemg able to say how many of them there were  
or what significance they might have had for himself or for others 
ashamed of himself  he woke stevan m exaggerated zeal and they 
both remained on guard until their relief arrived  

all that day  both when he was off duty and while he was mount  
ing guard  the picture of the young turkish girl passed like a vision 
coimtless times through his mind  next day  once again about noon 
when there were very few people on the bridge  she again crossed  
fedun agam saw that face framed in the bnghtly coloured shawl  all 
was as it had been the day before  only their glances were longer  
livelier and bolder  almost as if they were playing a game together 
stevan was again drowsing on the stone bench and later  as he always 
did  swore that he had not been asleep and that even when he was 
at home in bed he could not close an eye  on the way back the girl 
seemed almost ready to stop  looked the streiikorps boy straight m 
the eyes while he muttered a couple of vague and unimportant 
words  feeling as he did so that his legs failed him through emotion 
and forgetting completely where he was  

only in dreams do we dare so much  when the girl was once more 
lost to sight on the farther bank the young man shiverecl with fright  
it was incredible that a young turkish girl should think of looking 
at an austrian soldier  such an unheard of and imprecedented thing 
could only happen in dreams  in dreams or in spring on the kapia  
he knew very well that nothing in this land or in his position was as 
scandalous and as dangerous as to touch a moslem woman  they had 
told him that when he had been in the army and again in the streif  
korps  the punishment for such daring was a heavy one  there had 
been some who had paid with their lives at the hands of the insulted 
and infuriated turks  all that he knew  and most sincerely desired to 
keep the orders and regulations  but none the less he acted contrary 
to aem  the misfortune of imlucky men lies in just this  that those 
things which for them are impossible and forbidden become in a 
moment easy and attainable  or at least appear so  yet when once 
such things are firmly fixed in their desires they seem once again as 
they were  unattainable and forbidden  with all the ccoisequences 
that they have for those who  despite everything  still attempt them  

on the third day too  about noon  the turkish girl appeared  and 
as it is in dreams all took place as he would have wished  like a unique 
reality to which all else was subordinate  stevan was again drowsing  
convinced and always ready to convince others that he had not 
closed an eye  there were no passers by on the kapia  the young man 
spoke again  muttering a few words  and the girl slowed her pace and 
replied  equally timidly and vaguely  

i o 



the dangerous and incredible game went on  on the fourth day 
the girl in passing  choosing a moment when there was no one on 
the kapia  asked in a whisper when he would next be on guard  he 
told her that he would be on duty on the kapia again at dusk  

 i will bring my old grandmother to the market place  where she 
is to spend the night  and i will return alone   whispered the girl with  
out stopping or turning her head  but darting a provocative and 
eloquent glance at him  and in each of those very ordinary words 
was the hidden joy that she would soon see him again 
six hours later fedun was once more on the kapia with his sleepy 
comrade  after the rain a chill twilight had fallen which seemed to 
him full of promise  passers by became fewer and fewer then on 
the road from osojmca the turkish girl appeared  wrapped in her 
shawl  its colours dimmed by the twilight  beside her walked an old  
bowed turkish woman bundled up in a thick black leridjah  she 
walked almost on all fours  supporting herself by a staff in her right 
hand and holding on to the girl with her left  

they passed by fedun  the girl walked slowly  accommodating 
her pace to the slow walk of the old crone whom she was leading 
her eyes  made larger by the shadows of early dusk  now gazed 
boldly and openly into the young man s as if they could not look 
away from him when they disappeared into the market place  a 
shiver passed through the youth and he began to pace with more 
rapid steps from one terrace to the other as if he wanted to make up 
for what he had lost  with an excitement that was almost fear he 
waited for the girvs return  stevan was dozing 
 what will she say to me when she passes   thought the youth 
 what shall i say to her  will she perhaps suggest meeting some  
where at night in a quiet spot   he quivered with delight and the ex  
citement of danger lay in that thought 
a whole hour passed thus  waiting  and the half of another  and 
still the girl did not return  but even in that waiting there was delight 
his eagerness rose with the falling darkness  at last  instead of the 
girl  his relief came  but this time not only the two streiikorps men 
who were to remain there on guard but also the sergeant major 
draienovid in person  a strict man with a short black beard  he 
ordered fedun and stevan in a sharp and strident voice to go to the 
dormitory as soon as they reached barracks and not to leave it until 
further orders  the blood rushed to fedun s face at the idea that he 
was in some way to blame  

the huge chill dormitory with twelve regularly spaced out beds 
was empty  the men were all at supper or in the town fedun and 
stevan waited  troubled and impatient  thinking things over and 

f i r 



making vam guesses why the sergeant major had been so stern and 
had so unexpectedly confined them to barracks  after an hoim  when 
the first of the soldiers began to come m to sleep  a corporal burst in 
and ordered them loudly and harshly to follow him  from every  
thing about him  the two felt that the severity against them was in  
creasing and that all this presaged no good as soon as they left the 
dormitory they were separated and questioned  

the night wore on  even the last hghts m the town were ex  
tinguished  but the windows of the barracks still blazed with light  
from time to nme there was a ring at the main gates  the clink of keys 
and the thud of heavy doors  orderhes came and went  hurrying 
through the dark and sleeping town between the barracks and the 
konak  where lamps also burned on the first floor  it could be seen 
from all these signs that something unusual was afoot  

when  about eleven o clock at night  they brought fedun into the 
sergeant major s ofiice  it seemed to him that days and weeks had 
passed from those moments on the kapia  on the table burned a 
metal oil lamp with a shade of green porcelain  by it was seated the 
major  krimar  the hght fell on his arms up to the elbows  but the 
upper half of his body and his head were in shadow cast by the green 
shade  the young man knew that pale  full  almost womanly face  
clean shaven  with fine moustaches and dark rings around the eyes  
the soldiers feared the slow heavy words of this big placid officer  
there were few of them who could endure for long the gaze of those 
large grey eyes  and who did not stammer when replying to his ques  
tions  in which each word was softly yet separately  distinctly and 
clearly enunciated from the first to the last syllable as at school or m 
the theatre  a little away from the table stood the sergeant major 
drazenovid  the whole upper part of his body also was in shadow 
and only his hands were strongly illuminated  hanging limply at his 
side  on one finger glistened a heavy gold rmg  

draienovid opened the interrogation  

 tell us how you passed the time between five and seven o clock 
while you were with assistant streilkorps private stevan kalacan on 
guard duty on the kapia   

the blood rushed to fedun s head  every man passed his time as 
best he could  but no one had ever thought that he would later have 
to answer for it before some strict judge and give account of every  
thing that had taken place  to the minutest detail  to the most hidden 
thoughts and the last minute  no one  least of all when one is twenty  
three years old and that time has been spent on the kapia in spring  
what was he to answer  those two hours on guard had passed as 
they had always done  as they had done the day before and the day 

    



before that but at that moment he could not remember anything 
everyday and usual which he could report  only incidental  for  
bidden thmgs rose m his memory  things that happen to everyone 
but which are not told to one s supenors  that stevan had dozed as 
usual  that he  fedun  had exchanged a few words with an unknown 
turkish girl  that then  as dusk was falling  he had sung softly and 
fervently all the songs of his own country awaiting the girl s return 
and with it something exciting and unusual  how hard it was to 
reply  impossible to tell everything but embarrassing to remain 
silent  and he must hurry  for time was passing and that only in  
creased his confusion and embarrassment  how long had his silence 
lasted already  

 well   said the major  everyone knew that  well  of his  clear  
smooth and forceful like the sound of some strong  complex and well 
oiled machine  

fedun began to stammer and get confused as though he felt him  
self guilty from the very start  

the night wore on  but the lamps were not extinguished either in 
the barracks or in the konak interrogations  evidence and the con  
frontation of witnesses followed one another  others who had 
mounted guard on the kapia that day were also interrogated  but it 
was clear that the net was closing around fedun and stevan and  in 
their interrogation  about the old turkish woman whom a young girl 
had taken across the bridge  

it seemed to the young man as if all the magical and inextricable 
responsibilities that he had felt in his dreams were falling on his 
shoulders  before dawn he was confronted with stevan  the peasant 
closed his eyes cunningly and spoke in a forced  oice  continually 
harking back to the fact that he was an illiterate man  a peasant  and 
sheltering himself from all responsibility by always referring to  that 
mr fedun  as he insisted on calling his companion on guard  

that s the way to answer  the young man thought to himself his 
entrails were crying out from hunger and he himself was trembling 
all over from emotion though it was still not clear to him what this 
was all about and where exactly lay the question of his guilt or inno  
cence  but morning brought complete explanation  

all through that night a fantastic round dance whirled about him  
in its centre was the major  cold and implacable  himself dumb and 
unmoving  he allowed no one else to be silent or at peace  in bearing 
and appearance he no longer seemed like a man  but like duty em  
bodied  the terrible ministrant of justice inaccessible to weakness or 
sentiment  gifted with supernatural strength and immune from the 
ordinary human needs of food  rest or sleep  when dawn broke  

    



fedun was once again brought before the major there was now in 
the oflsce  besides the major and dra enovid  an armed gendarme 
and a woman who  at first sight  seemed unreal to the young man  
the lamp had been extinguished  the room  facing north  was cold 
and in semi darkness  the young man felt as if this were a continua  
tion of his dream of the night before which refused to pale and 
vanish even in the light of day  

 is that the man who was on guard   dra  enovid asked the woman 

with a great effort which caused him pain fedun only then looked 
full at her she was the moslem girl of the day before  only bare  
headed without her shawl and with her heavy chestnut plaits 
wrapped around her head  she was wearing bnghtly coloured 
turkish trousers  but the rest of her dress  blouse  sash and bolero  
was that of the serbian girls from the villages on the high plateau 
above the town  without her shawl  she seemed older and sturdier  
her face seemed different  her mouth large and bad tempered  her 
eyelids reddened and her eyes clear and flashing as if the shadows of 
the day before had fled from them  

 it is   the woman replied indifferently in a hard voice which was 
as new and unusual to fedun as her present appearance  

draienovid went on asking her how many times in all she had 
crossed the bridge  what she had said to fedun and he to her  she re  
plied for the most part precisely  but proudly and indifferently  

 good  jelenka  and what did he say to you the last time you 
crossed   

 he said something but i don t know exactly what  for i was not 
listening but only thinking how i could get jakov across   

 you were thinking of that   

 of that   answered the woman unwillingly she was clearly worn 
out and did not want to say more than she must  but the sergeant  
major was inexorable  in a threatening voice which betrayed his con  
viction that he must be answered without argument he forced the 
woman to repeat all that she had said at her first interrogation at the 
konak  

she defended herself  shortened and skipped various bits of her 
earlier evidence  but he always checked her and by sharp and skilful 
questioning made her go back over it all again  

little by little the whole truth was laid bare  her name was 
jelenka and she came from the village of tasid in upper lijeska  last 
autumn the haiduk jakov cekrlija had come into her district to pass 
the winter hidden in a stable above her village  they had brought him 
food and clothing from her house  for the most part it had been she 
who had brought it  they had liked the look of each other and had 

    



become lovers  when the snow began to melt and the streukorps 
squads came more frequently  jakov had decided to cross into serbia 
at all costs  at that time of year the dnna was hard to cross even if it 
had not been patrolled and there had not been a permanent guard on 
the bridge she had gone with him  determmed to help him even at 
the risk of her life they had first descended to lijeska and then to 
a cave above okoliste  earlier  on glasmac  jakov had obtained some 
turkish women s clothes from some gipsies  a fendjab  turkish 
trousers and a shawl  then she  on his instructions  began to cross 
the bridge at a time when there were not many turks about  since 
one of them might ask whose was that unknown girl  and m order 
that the guard might grow accustomed to her  thus she crossed three 
days running  and then decided to take jakov with her  

 and why did you take him across when this particular soldier 
was on guard   

 because he seemed to me the softest of them   

 so   

 so  

at the sergeant major s insistence the woman continued  when 
everything had been prepared  jakov had wrapped himself in the 
feridjah and just as it was beginning to get dark she took him dis  
guised as her old grandmother across the bridge past the guard  the 
guard had noticed nothing  for this young man was looking at her 
and not at the old woman  while the other  older guard was sitting 
on the sofa dozing  

when they got to the market place  they had taken the precaution 
of not going nght across it  but had used the side streets  it was this 
had proved their undoing  they had lost their way in the town  
which neither of them knew  and instead of coming out at the bridge 
across the rzav and thus joining the road which led from the town 
towards both frontiers  they had found themselves in front of a 
turkish caf  just as some people were coming out one of them was 
a turkish gendarme  bom in the town  this closely wrapped up old 
woman and the girl whom he had never seen before seemed suspect 
to him  and he followed them  he kept them in sight as far as the 
rzav  then he came nearer to ask them who they were and where 
they were going  jakov  who had been watching him attentively 
through his face veil  considered that the moment had come to flee  
he threw off his feridjah  and pushed jelenka at the gendarme so 
violently that they both lost their footing   for he is small and in  
significant to look at  but as strong as the earth and courageous above 
all other men    she  as she calmly and clearly confessed  tangled hor  
self with the legs of the gendarme  by the time that the gendarme had 

ids 



freed himself of her  jakov had already rushed across the rzav as if 
it had been a stream  though the water was above his knees  and was 
lost in the willow clumps on the farther side  then they had taken 
her to the koaak  beaten and threatened her  but she had nothing 
more to say and would say nothing more  

in vain the sergeant major tried evasive questions  flatteries and 
threats to get something more out of the girl  to learn from her about 
others who helped or sheltered bandits  or about jakov s further in  
tentions  all this had not the slightest effect on her  she had spoken 
freely enough of what she wanted to tell but despite all dra enovid s 
efforts they could not get a word out of her about what she did not 
want to tell  

 it would be better for you to tell us all you know than for us to 
question and torture jakov who has surely by now been caught on 
the frontier   

 caught who  him  ha  ha   

the girl looked at the sergeant major with pity  as at a man who 
does not know what he is talking about  and the right corner of her 
upper lip rose disdainfully  in fact the movement of this upper lip  
which looked like a wnthing leech  expressed her feelings of anger  
disdain or pride  whenever those feelings grew more than she could 
express in words  that writhing movement gave for a moment to her 
otherwise beautiful and regular face a troubled and impleasant ex  
pression  then with some quite childlike and fervent expression 
completely in contrast to that ugly writhing she looked out of the 
window as a peasant looks at a field when he wants to gauge the in  
fluence of the weather on the harvest  

 god help you  it s dawn now  from last night till now he has had 
time to get across all bosnia  not merely to cross a frontier only an 
hour or two s march away  i know that much  you can beat me and 
kill me  i came with him for that  but him you will never see again  
don t even dream of it  ha   

her upper lip writhed and lifted and her whole face seemed sud  
denly older  more experienced  bold and ugly  and when that lip 
suddenly ceased to writhe  her face again took on that childlike ex  
pression of bold and innocent daring  

not knowing what more to do  dra enovi f looked at the major  
who gave a sign to send the girl away  then he resumed the interro  
gation of fedun  this could no longer be either long or hard  the 
young man admitted everything and had nothing to put forward in 
his own defence  not even what dra enovi   himself had hinted at in 
his questions  not even the major s words which contained a merci  
less and implacable judgment  but in which none the less there was 


i   



restrained pain because of their own severity  could wake the youth 
from his torpor  

 i had always considered you  fedun   krjmar said in german   a 
serious young man  conscious of your duties and of your aim in life  
and i had thought that one day you would become a perfect soldier  
a credit to our unit  but you have been blinded by the first female 
animal to run in front of your nose  you have behaved like a weak  
ling  like one to whom serious work cannot be entrusted  i am forced 
to hand you over to court martial  but whatever its sentence may 
be  your greatest punishment will be to know that you have not 
shown yourself worthy of the confidence placed in you and that at 
the right moment you were unable to behave at your post like a man 
and a soldier  now go   

not even these words  heavy  curt  carefully enunciated  could 
bring anything fresh to the young man s mind he felt all that al  
ready  the appearance and speech of that woman  the bandit s mis  
tress  the behaviour of stevan and the whole course of that short en  
quiry had suddenly revealed to him in its true light his thoughtless  
naive and unpardonable spring fever on the kapia  the major s words 
only seemed to him to place the official seal on all that  they were 
more necessary to the major himself  in order to satisfy some un  
written but eternal demand for law and order  than to fedun  as be  
fore a prospect of unsuspected grandeur  the young man found him  
self faced with a knowledge that he could not grasp  the meaning of 
a few moments of forgetfulness in an evil hour and m a dangerous 
place had they been lived through and remained unknown  there on 
the kapia  they would have meant nothing at all  one of those youth  
ful pranks later told to friends during dull patrol duties at night  but 
thus  reduced to a question of definite responsibility  they meant 
everything they meant more than death  they meant the end of 
everything  an unwanted and unworthy end  there would be no 
more full and frank explanations either to himself or to comrades  
there w ould be no more letters from kolomea  no more family 
photographs  no money orders such as he had sent home with pride  
it was the end of one who has deceived himself and allowed others 
to deceive him  

therefore he found not a word to reply to the major  

the supervision over fedun was not particularly strict  they gave 
him breakfast  which he ate as though with someone else s mouth  
and ordered him to pack up his personal effects  hand in his arms and 
all government property and be ready to leave at ten o clock accom  
panied by a gendarme by the postal courier for sarajevo  where he 
would be handed over to the garrison court  

    



while the young man was taking down his things from the shelf 
above his bed  those of his comrades who were still in the dormitory 
tiptoed out  closing the door carefully and silently behind them  
around him grew that circle of loneliness and deep silence which is 
always formed around a man whom ill fortune has struck  as around 
a sick animal  first he took off its hooks the black tablet on which 
his name  rank  detachment number and unit were written in oil 
colours in german and placed it on his knees  with the writing down  
on the black back of the tablet the young man scribbled hastily with 
a scrap of chalk   all that i leave please send to my father at kolomea  
i send greetings to all my comrades and beg my superiors to pardon 
me  g  fedun   then he looked once more through the window  
relishing that little piece of the outside world that he was able to see 
through its narrow frame  then he took down his rifle  loaded it with 
a single charge of ball still sticky with grease  then he took off his 
shoes and ivith a penknife cut his stocking over his big toe  lay down 
on the bed  wrapped his arms and legs around the rifle so that the top 
of the barrel was pressed firmly beneath his chm  shifted his right leg 
so that the hole in his stocking fitted over the trigger and pressed  the 
sound of the shot rang through the barracks  

after a great decision  everything becomes simple and easy  the 
doctor came  a commission of enquiry was held and attached to its 
findings a record in duplicate of fedun s interrogation  

then arose the question of fedun s bunal  draienovid was ordered 
to go to pop nikola and discuss the matter with him  could fedun be 
buried in the graveyard even though he had taken his own life  and 
would the priest agree to conduct the service  for the deceased was 
by faith a uniate  

in the last year pop nikola had suddenly grown old and weak in 
his legs  so he had taken as assistant for his great parish pop joso  a 
taciturn and nervous sort of man  thin and black as a spent match  
in the previous few months  he had carried out almost all the duties 
of the priest and the services in the town and villages  while pop 
nikola  who could only move with difficulty  dealt mainly with 
what he could do at home or in the church next to his house  

by the major s order  draienovid went to pop nikola  the old man 
received him lying on a divan  by him stood pop joso  after 
draienovid had explained the circumstances of fedun s death and 
the question of his burial  both priests remained silent for a moment  
seeing that pop nikola did not speak  pop joso began first  timidly 
and xmcertainly  the matter was exceptional and unusual  there were 
difficultly both in the canons of the church and in established ctis  
tom  but if it could be shown that the suicide had not been of sound 


i   



mind then something might be done  but then pop nikola sat up on 
his hard and narrow couch  covered with an old and faded rug  his 
body once again assumed that monumental form which it had once 
had when he walked through the market place and was greeted on 
all sides  the first word that he said illuminated his broad and still 
ruddy face  with his huge moustaches which tangled in his beard 
and his heavy almost white eyebrows  thick and bushy  the face of 
a man who has learnt from birth how to think independently  to give 
his opinion sincerely and to defend it well  

without hesitation and without big words he answered both priest 
and sergeant major directly  

 now that the misfortune has happened  there is nothing more to 
be done about it  who with a sound mind would ever raise his hand 
against himself  and who would dare to take it on his soul to bury 
him as if he were without faith  somewhere behind a fence and with  
out a priest  but you  sir  go and give orders that the dead man be pre  
pared and we shall bury him as soon as we can  in the graveyard  
most certainly  i will sing his requiem  later  if ever some priest of 
his law should happen to pass this way  let him add or alter as he 
wishes  should he not find everything to his liking   

when draienovid had left  he turned once more to pop joso  
who was astonished and humiliated  

 how could we forbid a christian to be buried in the graveyard  
and why should i not sing his requiem  isn t it enough that he had 
bad luck when he was alive  there  on the other side  let those ask 
about his sins who will ask all the rest of us about ours   

thus the young man who had made his mistake on the kapia re  
mained for ever in the town  he was buried the following morning  
pop nikola sang the requiem  assisted by the sacristan dimitrije  

one by one his comrades of the streifkorps filed past the grave and 
each threw on it a handful of earth  while two sextons worked 
rapidly  they stood there a few seconds longer as if waiting for 
orders  looking across to the far side of the river where  close to their 
own barracks  rose a straight white column of smoke there  on the 
level patch of grass above the barracks  they were burning the blood  
stained straw from fedun s mattress  

the cruel fate of the young streifkorps boy  whose name no one 
ever remembered and who had paid with his life for a few spring 
moments of inattention and emotion on the kapia  was one of those 
incidents for which the townspeople had much understanding and 
long remembered and repeated  the memory of that sensitive and 
unlucky youth lasted far longer than the guard on the kapia  

by next autumn the insurrection in herzegovina had fizzled out  

    



a few of the more important leaders  m  slems and serbs  fled to 
montenegro or turkey  there remained only a few haiduks who in 
fact never had much real connection with the insurrection about 
conscription but had worked for themselves  then those too were 
either captured or driven away  herzegovina was pacified  bosnia 
gave recruits without resistance  but the departure of the first re  
cruits was neither simple nor easy  

not more than loo young men were taken from the entire dis  
trict  but on the day they were mustered before the konak  peasants 
with their bags and a few townsmen with their wooden chests  it 
seemed as if there were plague and uproar in the town  many of the 
recruits had been drinking steadily from early morning and mixing 
their drinks the peasants were in clean white shirts there were 
few who had not been drinking and these sat near their belongings  
drowsing behind a wall  the majority were excited  flushed with 
drink and sweating in the heat of the day  four or five boys from the 
same village would embrace  and then put their heads close together 
and swaying like a living forest begin a harsh and long drawn chant  
ing as if they were the only people in the world  

 oy my mai ai ai ai den  o o o y   

a far greater commotion than that made by the recruits them  
selves was made by the women  mothers  sisters and other relatives 
of the young men  who had come from distant villages to say fare  
well  to see them for the last time  to weep  to wail and to give them 
some last gift or final sign of love  the square near the bridge was 
packed with women  they sat there as if turned to stone  talked 
among themselves and from time to time wiped away their tears 
with the fringes of their kerchiefs  in vain it had been earlier ex  
plained to them in their villages that the young men were going 
neither to war nor to slavery  but that they would serve the emperor 
in vienna  and be well fed  well clothed and well shod  that after a 
term of two years they would return home  and that young men 
from all the other parts of the empire served in the army  and that 
they served for a three year term  all that passed over their heads 
like the wind  foreign and completely incomprehensible  they 
listened only to their instincts and would only be guided by them  
these ancient and inherited instincts brought tears to their eyes and 
a wail to their throats  forced them persistently to follow as long as 
they could and try to get a last glance at him whom they loved more 
than life and whom an unknown emperor was carrying off into an 
unknown land  to unknown trials and tasks  in vain even now the 
gendarmes and officials from the konak went among them and 
assured them that there was no reason for such exaggerated grief  


    



and advised them not to block the way nor rush after the recruits 
and create trouble and disorder  for they would all return hale and 
hearty  but it was all in vain  the women listened to them  agreed to 
all they said dully and humbly and then returned once more to their 
tears and wailing  it seemed as if they loved their tears and their 
wailing as much as they loved those for whom they wept  

when the time came to move and the young men were drawn up 
in four ranks in the correct manner and moved across the bridge  a 
crowding and rushing began in which even the most equable of gen  
darmes could hardly retain his composure  the women ran and tore 
themselves from the hands of the gendarmes in order to be beside 
someone of their own  pushing and overturning one another  their 
wails were mingled with cries  entreaties and last moment recom  
mendations  some of them even ran in front of the line of recruits 
whom four gendarmes were keeping in file and fell under their feet  
clutching at their bare breasts and shouting  

 over my body  over my body   

the men lifted them up with difficulty  carefully disentangling 
boots and spurs from dishevelled hair and disordered skirts  

some of the recruits  ashamed  tried by angry gestures to make the 
women return home  but most of the young men sang or shouted  
increasing the general disorder  the few townsmen among them  pale 
with emotion  sang together in the town manner  

 in sarajevo and bosnia 
every mother mourns 
who has sent her son 
as a recruit for the emperor 

this song created even greater weeping  

when  somehow or other  they crossed the bridge towards which 
the whole convoy was headed and took the sarajevo road  all the 
townspeople were awaiting them  drawn up on each side of the road  
in order to see the recruits and to weep for them as if they were 
being taken away to be shot  there were many women there too who 
wept for every one of them although none of their own relations was 
amongst those who were going  for every woman has some reason 
to weep and weeping is sweetest when it is for another s sorrow  

but little by little the ranks along the road became sparser  even 
some of the peasant women gave up  the most persistent were the 
mothers who ran around the convoy as though they were fifteen 
years old  leapt the ditch at the side of the road from one side to the 
other and tried to outwit the gendarmes and stay as long as possible 
close to their sons  when they saw that  the young men themselves  


    



pale with emotion and a sort of embarrassment  turned and shouted  

 get along home when i tell you   

but the mothers went on for long  blind to all save the sons that 
were being taken from them and listening to nothing save their own 
weeping  

but even these troublous days passed  the people dispersed to their 
villages and the town again grew calm  when letters and the first 
photographs from the recruits m vienna began to arrive  everything 
became easier and more tolerable the women wept for long over 
those letters and photographs  but more gently and more calmly  

  the streilkorps was disbanded and left the barracks  for a long 
time there had been no guard on the kapia and the townsfolk went 
on sitting there as they had done before  

two years quickly pass  that autumn the first recruits returned 
from vienna  clean  close cropped and well fed  the people clus  
tered around them as they told tales of army life and of the greatness 
of the cities they had seen  their talk interlarded with strange names 
and unfamiliar expressions at the next call up there was less weep  
ing and agitation  

generally speaking  everything became easier and more normal 
young men grew up who no longer had any clear or lively memory 
of turkish times and who had to a great extent accepted the new 
ways  but on the kapia they still lived according to the ancient cus  
tom of the town  without regard for the new fashions of dress  new 
professions and new trades  the townspeople still went on meeting 
there as they had done for centuries past  in those conversations 
which had always been and still were a real need of their hearts and 
their imaginations the recruits went to their service without uproar 
and without commotion  the haiduks were mentioned only in old 
men s tales  the streilkorps was forgotten as completely as that 
earlier turkish guard when there had been a blockhouse on the 
kapia

l ife in the town beside the bridge became more and more 
animated  seemed more and more orderly and fuller  assuming 
an even pace and a hitherto tinknown balance  that balance 
towards which all life tends  everywhere and at all times  
and which is only rarely  partially and temporarily achieved  

in the far off cities unknown to the townsmen whence at that 
time the power and administration over these districts originated  
there was  in the last quarter of the nineteenth century  one of 
those short and rare lulls in human relationships and social events  
something of that lull could be felt even in these remote districts  
just as a great calm at sea may be felt even in the most distant 
creeks  

such were those three decades of relative prosperity and apparent 
peace in the franz josef manner  when many europeans thought 
that there was some infallible formula for the realization of a 
centuries old dream of full and happy development of individuality 
in freedom and in progress  when the nineteenth century spread 
out before the eyes of millions of men its many sided and deceptive 
prosperity and created its fata morgana of comfort  security and 
happiness for all and everyone at reasonable prices and even on 
cr t terms  but to this remote bosnian township only broken 
echoes penetrated of all this life of the nineteenth century  and 
those only to the extent and in the form in which this backward 
oriental society could receive them and in its own manner under  
stand and accept them 

after the first years of distrust  misunderstanding and hesitation  
when the first feeling of transience had passed  the town began 
to find its place in the new order of things  the people found 
order  work and security  that was enough to ensure that here 
too life  outward life at least  set out  on the road of perfection 
and progress   everything else was fiushed away into that dark 
background of consciousness where live and ferment the basic 
feelings and indestructible beliefs of individual races  faiths and 


    



castes  which  to all appearances dead and buried  are prepanng for 
later far off times unsuspected changes and catastrophes without 
which  it seems  peoples cannot exist and above all the peoples 
of this land  

the new authorities  after the first misunderstandings and clashes  
left among the townspeople a definite impression of firmness and 
of permanence  they were themselves impregnated with this belief 
without which there can be no strong and permanent authonty   
they were impersonal and indirect and for that reason more easily 
bearable than the former turkish rulers  all that was cruel and 
grasping was concealed by the dignity and glitter of traditional 
forms  the people still feared the authorities but in much the same 
way as they feared sickness and death and not as one fears malice  
misery and oppression  the representatives of the new authonty  
military as well as civil  were for the most part newcomers to the 
land and unskilful m their dealings with the people and were 
themselves of little importance  but with every step they made 
they felt themselves to be part of a greater mechanism and that 
behind each one of them stood more powerful men and greater 
organizations in long rows and countless gradations that gave 
them a standing which far surpassed their own personality and a 
magic influence to which it was easier to submit  by their titles 
which appeared to be great  by their calm and their european 
customs  they aroused among the people  from whom they so 
greatly differed  feelings of confidence and respect and did not 
excite envy or real criticism  even though they were neither pleasant 
nor loved  

on the other hand  after a certain time  even these newcomers 
were unable to avoid completely the influence of the unusual 
oriental milieu in which they had to live  their children introduced 
the children of the townspeople to strange phrases and foreign 
names  brought with them new games and toys  but equally they 
easily picked up from the local children the old songs  ways of 
speech  oaths and the traditional games of knucklebones  leap frog 
and the like  it was the same with the grown ups  they too brought 
a new order  with unfamiliar words and habits  but at the same 
time they too accepted every day somethmg of the speech and 
manner of life of the older inhabitants  it is true that the local 
people  especially the christians and jews  began to look more 
and more like the newcomers in dress and behaviour  but the 
newcomers themselves did not remain unchanged or imtouched 
by the milieu in which they had to live  many of these officials  
the fiery magyar or the haughty pole  crossed the bridge with 


    



reluctance and entered the town with disgust and  at first  were 
a world apart  hke drops of oil in water  yet a year or so later 
they could be found sitting for hours on the kapia  smoking through 
thick amber cigarette holders and  as if they had been bom in the 
town  watching the smoke expand and vanish under the clear 
sky m the motionless air of dusk  or they would sit and wait for 
supper with the local notables on some green hillock  with plum 
brandy and snacks and a little bouquet of basil before them  
conversing leisurely about trivialities or drinking slowly and 
occasionally munchmg a snack as the townsmen knew how to do 
so well  there were some among these newcomers  officials or 
artisans  who married in the town and had decided never to leave it  

but for none of the townspeople did the new life mean the 
realization of what they felt deep down within themselves and 
had always desired  on the contrary all of them  moslems and 
christians alike  had taken their place in it with many and definite 
reservations  but these reservations were secret and concealed  
whereas life was open and powerful with new and apparently 
great possibilities  after a longer or shorter period of wavering  most 
of them fell in with the new ideas  did their busmess  made fresh 
acquisitions  and lived according to the new ideas and customs 
which offered greater scope and  it seemed  gave greater chances 
to every individual  

not that the new existence was in any way less subject to 
conditions or less restricted than in turkish times  but it was easier 
and more humane  and those conditions and restrictions were now 
far away and skilfully enforced  so that the individual did not 
feel them directly  therefore it seemed to everyone as if the life 
around him had suddenly grown wider and clearer  more varied 
and fuller  

the new state  with its good administrative apparatus  had 
succeeded in a painless manner  without brutality or commotion  
to extract taxes and contributions from the local people which 
the turkish authorities had extracted by crude and irrational 
methods or by simple plunder  and  moreover  it got as much or 
more  even more swiftly and surely  

even as the gendarmes  in their own time  had replaced the 
soldiers and after the soldiers had come the officials  so now  after 
the officials  came the merchants  felling began in the forests and 
brought with it foreign contractors  engineers and workers  and 
provided varied sources of gain for the ordinary people and traders  
with changes in dress and speech  the first hotel was built  of 
which we shall have much to say later  canteens and workshops 


m 



sprang up which had not been known hitherto  besides the spanish 
speaking jews  the sephardi  who had been living in the town 
for hundreds of years  for they had first settled there about the 
timp when the badge had been built  there now came the galician 
jews  the ashkenazi  

like fresh blood  money began to circulate in hitherto unknown 
quannties and  which was the mam thmg  publicly  boldly and 
openly  in that exciting circulation of gold  silver and negotiable 
paper  every man could warm his hands or at least  gladden his 
eyes   for it created even for the poorest of men the illusion that 
his own bad luck was only temporary and therefore the more 
bearable  

earlier too there had been money and rich people  but these 
last had been rare and had concealed their money like a snake 
its legs and hdd revealed their superiority only as a form of power 
and protection  difficult both for themselves and for those about 
them  now wealth  or what passed as such and was so named  
was openly displayed m the form of pleasure and personal satisfac  
tion therefore the mass of the people could see something of its 
glitter and its gleanmgs  

so it was with all else  pleasures which up till then had been 
stolen and concealed  could now be purchased and openly displayed  
which increased their attraction and the number of those who 
sought them  what had earlier been unattainable  far off and ex  
pensive  forbidden by law or all powerful custom  now became  
in many cases  possible and attainable to all who had or who 
knew  many passions  appetites and demands which till then had 
been hidden in remote places or left completely unsatisfied could 
now be boldly and openly sought and fully or at least partially 
satisfied  in fact even m that there was greater restriction  order 
and legal hindrance  vices were punished and enjoyments paid 
for even more heavily and dearly than before  but the laws and 
methods were different and allowed the people  in this as in all 
else  the illusion that life had suddenly become wider  more 
luxurious and freo   

thwe were not many more real pleasures nor  certainly  more 
happiness but it was undoubtedly easier to come by such pleasures 
and it seemed that there was room for everyone s happiness  the 
old inborn partiality of the people of visegrad for a carefree life 
of enjoyment found both support and possibilities of realization 
in the new customs and the new forms of trading and profit brought 
by the newcomers  immigrant polish jews with their numerous 
families based all thdr business on that  schreiber opened what 

    



he called a  general store   gutcnplan a canteen for the soldiers  
zahler ran a hotel  the sperling brothers set up a soda water factory 
and a photographer s  atelier  and zveker a jeweller s and watch  
maker s shop  

after the barracks which had replaced the stone han  municipal 
offices were built of the stone that remained  with local administra  
tive offices and courts  after these  the largest building in the 
town was the zahler hotel it was built on the river bank just 
beside the bndge  that right bank had been supported by an 
ancient retaining wall which shored up the bank on both sides 
of the bridge and had been built at the same time so it happened 
that both to left and right of the bridge stretched two level spaces  
like two terraces above the water  on these open spaces  which 
were called racecourses by the people of the town  children had 
played from generation to generation  now the local authorities 
took over the left hand  racecourse   put a fence round it and made 
a sort of municipal botanical garden  on the right hand one the 
hotel was built until then the first building at the entry to the 
market place had been zanje s mn it was  in the right place   for 
the tired and thirty traveller on entering the town from across 
the bridge must first light on it now it was overshadowed by the 
great building of the new hotel  the low old inn seemed every day 
lower and more humiliated as if it had sunk into the earth  

officially the new hotel had been given the name of the bridge 
beside which it had been built  but the townspeople named every  
thing according to their own special logic and according to the 
real significance it had for them  over the entrance of the zahler 
hotel the inscription  hotel zur brucke   which a soldier skilled 
in the trade had painted in large letters  quickly faded  the people 
called it  lotte s hotel  and the name stuck for the hotel was run 
by the fat and phlegmatic jew  zahler  who had a sickly wife  
deborah  and two little girls  mina and irene  but the real pro  
prietress was zahler s sister in law lotte  a young and very pretty 
widow with a free tongue and a masculine energy 

on the top floor of the hotel were six clean and well furnished 
guest rooms and on the ground floor two public rooms  one large 
and one small  the large one was patronized by the humbler clients  
ordinary citizens  non commissioned officers and artisans the 
smaller one was separated from the larger by large frosted glass 
doors on one of which was written extra and on the other 
zimmer  that was the social centre for officials  officers and the 
richer townspeople  one drank and played cards  sang  danced  
held serious conversations and closed business deals  ate well and 


    



slept well in clean sheets at lotte s  it often happened that the 
tarns group of begs  merchants and officials would sit from dusk 
until dawn and still go on until they collapsed from dnnk and 
lack of sleep or grew so tired over their cards that they could no 
longer distinguish them  they no longer played hidden away secretly 
in that dark stuffy cubby hole at ustamujid s inn   those who had 
drunk too much or had lost all they had lotte would see off the 
premises and then turn to welcome fresh and sober guests eager 
for drink and play  no one knew and no one ever asked when that 
woman rested  when she slept or ate and when she found time 
to dress and freshen herself up  for she was always there  or at 
least so it seemed  at everyone s beck and call  always amiable  
always the same and always bold and discreet  well bmlt  plump  
with ivory white skin  black hair and smouldering eyes  she had 
a perfectly assured manner of dealing wnth guests  who would 
spend freely but were often aggressive and crude when overcome 
by drink  she would talk sweetly  boldly  wittily  sharply  flatter  
ingly with all of them  smoothing them down  her voice was 
hoarse and uneven but could at moments become a sort of deep 
and soothing cooing she spoke incorrectly  for she never learnt 
serbian well  in her own piquant and picturesque language in 
which the cases were never right and the genders uncertain  but 
which in tone and meaning was entnely in keeping wdth the local 
v ay of expression  every client had her at his disposal to listen to all 
his troubles and desires in recompense for the money he spent and 
the time he wasted but these two things  spending money and 
wasting time  were all he could be sure of  everyone thought there 
would be more to it  whereas in fact there was not  for two genera  
tions of the nch spendthrifts of the town lotte was a glittering  ex  
pensive and cold fata morgana who played with their senses  those 
rare individuals who had supposedly got something out of her  
but who were quite unable to say what or how much  were the 
subject of local stories  

it was no simple matter to know how to deal with the rich and 
drunk townsmen in whom unsuspected and coarse desires were 
often roused  but lotte  that untiring and cold woman of chilled 
passions  quick intelligence and masculine heart tamed every fury  
silenced every demand of uncontrolled men by the inexplicable 
play of her perfect body  her great cunning and her no less great 
daring  and always succeeded in maintaining the necessary distance 
between herself and them  which only served to inflame their desires 
and increase her own value  she played with these uncontrolled men 
in their coarsest and most dangerous moments of drunkenness and 

    



rage  like a torero with a bull  for she quickly got to know the 
people with whom she had to deal and easily found the key to 
their apparently complex demands and all the weak points of 
those cruel and sensual sentimentalists  she offered them every  
thing  promised much and gave little  or rather nothing at all  for 
their desires were  of their very nature  such as never could be 
satisfied and in the end they had to content themselves with little  
with most of her guests she behaved as if they were sick men 
who from time to time had passing crises and hallucinations  in 
fact it could be said that despite her trade  which of its nature 
was neither pleasant nor particularly chaste  she was an imder  
standing woman of kind nature and compassionate heart who 
could help and console whoever had spent more than he should 
on drinks or had lost more than he should at cards  she sent them 
all mad  for they were naturally mad  deceived them for they 
wanted to be deceived and  finally  took from them only what they 
had already been determined to throw away and lose  in fact she 
earned very much  took good care of her money and in the first 
few years had already managed to accumulate a considerable 
fortune  but she also knew how to  write off  a debt magnanimously 
and to forget a loss without a word  she gave to bcggers and the 
sick and with much tact and care helped rich families who had fallen 
into destitution  orphans and widows from better houses  all those 
 ashamed poor  who did not know how to beg and were embarrassed 
at accepting alms  all this she did with the same skill as she showed 
in running the hotel and controlling the drunken  lustful and 
aggressive guests  taking from them all that she could  giving them 
nothing and yet never refusing them finally or completely  

men who knew the world and its history often thought that it 
was a pity that fate had given this woman so narrow and undis  
tinguished a part to play  had her fate not been what or where 
it was  who knows what this wise and humane woman  who did not 
think only of herself and who  predatory yet unselfish  beautiful 
and seductive but also chaste and cold  ran a small town hotel and 
emptied the pockets of petty casanovas  could have been or could 
have given to the world  perhaps she would have been one of those 
famous women of whom history tells and who have controlled 
the destinies of great families  of courts or states  always turning 
everything to good  

at that time  about       when lotte was at the height of her 
powers  there were rich men s sons who spent days and nights in 
the hotel  in that special room with doors of milky frosted glass  


    



in the early evening they would drowse there  beside the stove  
forgetting in dreams or fatigue where they were or why they were 
sitting there or what they were waiting for profiting by this lull  
lotte would withdraw into a little room on the first floor intended 
for the potboys  which she had converted mto her  office  where 
she allowed no one to enter  that tiny room was heaped up with 
every kind of furniture  with photographs and objects of gold  silver 
and crystal there too  hidden behind a curtain  was lotte s green 
steel safe and her little desk which was quite mvisible beneath a 
pile of papers  bills  receipts  accounts  austrian newspapers  
cuttings about the money market and lottery lists  

in that tiny overcrowded and stuffy room  whose only window  
smaller than any other in the building  looked directly and at short 
range on to the smallest arch of the bridge  lotte spent her spare 
moments and lived that second  hidden part of her life which 
belonged to her alone  

in it lotte  in those hours of stolen freedom  read money market 
reports and studied prospectuses  wrote up accounts  answered 
letters from banks  made decisions  gave instructions  dealt with 
bank deposits and made fresh payments  to all those downstairs 
and to the world in general this was an unknown side of lotte s 
work  the true and invisible part of her life  there she cast aside 
the smiling mask and her face grew hard and her glance sharp 
and sombre from this room she corresponded with her very 
numerous relatives  the apfelmaiers of tarnovo  her married sisters 
and brothers  various nephews and nieces and all the hordes of 
jewish poor from eastern galicia  now scattered throughout galicia  
austria and hungary  she controlled the destimties of a whole 
dozen jewish families  entered into the minutest details of their 
lives  arranged their marrying and giving in marriage  sent healing 
to the sick  warned and admonished the workshy and spendthrift 
and praised the thrifty and industrious  she resolved their family 
quarrels  gave counsel in cases of misunderstanding and doubt  
and incited all of them to a more understanding  better and more 
dignified way of life and at the same time made this more possible 
and easier for them  for with each of her letters she sent a money 
order for a sum sufficient to ensure that her counsels were listened 
to and her advice followed and that certain spiritual or bodily 
needs be satisfied or shortages avoided  in this raising of the standard 
of the whole family and the setting of each individual member on 
his feet  she found her sole real satisfaction and a reward for all 
the burdens and renunciations of her life  with each member of 
the apfelmaier family who rose even a single step in the social 

i o 



scale  lotte felt that she too rose and in that found her reward 
for her hard work and the force to struggle onward  

sometimes it happened that when she came up from the extra  
zimmer so exhausted or disgusted that she had not even the strength 
to write or to read letters and accounts she simply went to the little 
window to breathe the fresh air from the river  then her gaze 
would fall on that strong and graceful arch of stone  which filled 
the entire view  and the swift waters beneath  at dusk or dawn  
in sunshine  winter moonlight or the soft light of the stars  that 
arch was always the same  its two sides swept upwards  met at 
the sharp apex and supported one another in perfect and unwavering 
balance  as the years rolled on that became her only and familiar 
view  the dumb  witness to whom this jewess with the two faces 
turned in the moments when she demanded rest and freshness and 
when in her trade and her family tnals  which she always solved 
for herself  she came to a dead centre and a point where there was 
no way out  

but such restful moments never lasted long for it always happened 
that they were interrupted by some cry from the caf  below  or 
new clients demanding her presence or some drunkard  awakened 
and ready for renewed onslaughts  shouting for more drinks  for 
the lamps to be lighted  for the orchestra to come  and always 
calling for lotte then she would leave her lair and  carefully locking 
the door with a special key  go down to welcome the guests  or 
by her smile and her special vocabulary to smooth down the 
drunkard like a newly awakened child and to help him to a chair 
where he could recommence his nightly session of drinking  con  
versation  song and spending 

down below everything went wrong when she was not there  
the guests squabbled among themselves a beg from cm e  young  
pale and haggard  spilled every drink brought to him  retorted 
to everything said to him and insisted on picking quarrels with 
the staff or the guests save for a few short intervals  he had been 
drmking in the hotel for days past  and lusting after lotte  but 
he had drunk so much and longed so greatly that it was clear that 
some deeper  much greater misery unknown even to himself was 
driving him on  something greater than his unrequited love for  and 
unreasonable jealousy of  the lovely jewess from tarnovo  

lotte went up to him fearlessly  easily and naturally 

 what is it  e mb  what are you making such a noise about   

 where have you been  i want to know where you have been     
stammered the drunkard in a voice already appeased and looking 
at her as if she were a vision   they are giving me some sort of 

i i 



poison to drink  they are poisoning me  but they do not know 
that i       if i     

 sit down  sit down quietly   the woman consoled him  with 
her white perfumed hands playing just in front of the young 
beg s face  sit down i will get you bird s milk to dnnk if you 
want it  i will get it for you myself   

she called the waiter and gave an order in german  

 don t talk that lingo which   don t understand in front of me  
all this rrtzen furtzen  for i       well you know me        

 i know  i know  eyub  i know no one better than you  eyub  
but you i know         

 hm  who have you been with  tell me   

the conversation between the drunk man and the sober woman 
maundered on without end or meaning  without sense or conclu  
sion  beside bottles of some expensive wine and two glasses  one  
lotte s  always full and the other  eyub s  continually filled and 
emptied 

while the young spendthrift stuttered and muttered on in his 
thick drunkard s voice about love  death  hopeless yearning and 
nmilar matters which lotte knew by heart  for they were the 
stock in trade of every local drunkard  she rose  went over to the 
other tables at which sat the other guests who met regularly every 
evening in the hotel  

at one table was a group of young worthies who had only 
just begun to frequent the cafds and drink  town snobs for whom 
zarije s inn was too boring and too ordinary and who were still 
intimidated by the hotel  at the others were officials  strangers  
with an officer or two who had abandoned the officers  mess for 
that day and come down to the civilian hotel with the aim of 
touching lotte for a quick loan  at a third were the engineers who 
were building the first forest railway for the export of timber  

in a comer reckoning something sat pavle rankovid  one of 
the young but richer merchants and some austrian or other  a 
contractor for the railway  pavle was in turkish style dress with 
a red fez which he did not take off in the cafe  his small eyes 
looked like two lighted slits  black and thin in his pale face  but 
which could widen and become unusually large and diabolically 
merry in exceptional moments of joy or triumph  the contractor 
was in a grey sports suit with high yellow laced boots which reached 
to his knees the contractor was writing with a gold pencil attached 
to a silver chain  and pavle with a short stub which some wood 
dealer  a military contractor  had left behind in his shop five years 
before when buying nails and hinges  they were concluding an 

    



agreement for the feeding of the workers on the line  completely 
wrapped up in their tasks  they multiplied  divided and added  they 
ranged rows of figures  one set visible  on paper  by which each 
hoped to convince and deceive the other  and another  invisible 
and in their heads  closely and quickly reckoned  in which each 
for himself sought for hidden possibilities and profits  

for each of these guests lotte found the right words  a full 
smile or even a silent glance full of understanding  then she 
returned once more to the young beg who was again beginning 
to become uneasy and aggressive  

in the course of that night  throughout the whole drinking bout  
with all its noisy  yearning  lachrymose or coarse phases  which 
she knew so well  lotte would find a few moments in which she 
could go back once again to her room and in the milky light of 
the porcelain lamp continue her rest or her correspondence  until 
downstairs some scene would begin again or until they called 
her down  

tomorrow was another day  just such another with the same 
scene of drunken spending  and for lotte the same anxieties which 
she must meet with a smiling face and the same task which always 
seemed an easy yet desperate game  

it seemed incomprehensible and inexplicable how lotte could 
manage the quantity and variety of tasks which she carried out 
day after day and which demanded of her more cunning than a 
woman has and more strength than any man could muster  but 
none the less she was able to finish everything  never complaining  
never explaining anything to anyone  never speaking about any task 
which she had just finished or which still awaited her  despite all 
that she always managed to find an hour or two every day for 
alibeg pasid  he was the only man whom the town believed had 
won lotte s sympathy  genuinely and independently of any source 
of profit  but he was also the most reserved and taciturn man in 
the town  the eldest of the four pali  brothers  he had never 
married  in the town it was believed that this was because of 
lotte   never took part m business or public life  he never drank 
to excess or went into cafds with men of his own age  he was 
always of the same mood  universally amiable and restrained 
towards all  without distinction  quiet and reserved  he did not 
avoid society or conversation  yet no one ever remembered any 
opinion expressed by him or ever repeated anything that he had 
said  he was sufficient unto himself and completely satisfied with 
what he was and what he seemed in the eyes of others  he himself 
had no need to be or to seem in any way different from what he 

    



was and no one expected him or asked him to be anything else 
he was one of those men who bear their social position as some 
heavy and noble calling which completely fills their lives  an inborn  
great and dignified position justified by itself alone and which 
cannot be explained  nor denied nor imitated  

with the guests in the large hall lotte had little contact that 
was the job of the waitress malsika and the  zahlkelner  gustav  
malcika was a shrewd hungarian girl well known to the whole 
town who looked like the wife of some lion tamer  and gustav  a 
small  reddish czech german of irrascible nature  bloodshot eyes  
bow legs and flat feet  they knew all the guests and all the towns  
people  they knew who were or were not good payers  their habits 
when drunk  whom to receive coldly and whom to welcome 
cordially and whom not to allow to enter at all for  he was not for 
this hotel  they took care that the guests should dnnk a lot and 
should pay regularly  but that everything should end smoothly and 
well since it was lotte s motto   nur kein skandal   if sometimes  
exceptionally  it so happened that someone went unexpectedly be  
serk in his cups or  after already getting drunk at some less reputable 
cafe  should force his way into the room  then milan the servant 
appeared  a tall broad shouldered and hairy man from lika  of gigan  
tic strength  a man who spoke little and did all the odd jobs he was 
always correctly dressed as a hotel servant  lotte saw to that  he 
was always in his shirt sleeves  with a brown waistcoat and white 
shirt  with a long apron of green cloth  with sleeves rolled back 
summer and winter to show his huge forearms as hairy as two 
brushes  and with finely waxed moustaches and black hair stiff with 
perfumed military pomade  milan was the man who extinguished 
every scandal at its very conception  

there was a long established and consecrated tactic for this dis  
agreeable and undesired operation  gustav kept the furious and 
drunken guest in conversation until milan came up behind him  then 
the zahlkelner suddenly moved out of the way and milan seized the 
drunkard from behind  one arm round his waist and the other round 
his neck  so swiftly and skilfully that no one was ever able to see 
what  milan s gnp  really was  tthen even the strongest of the town 
ne er do wells flew like a rag doll through the doors which malfika 
held open at just the right moment  and through them into the street  
at the same moment gustav threw his hat  stick and anything else 
he had with him after him and milan put the whole weight of his 
body and clanged down the metal shutter over the door  all this was 
over in the twinkling of an eye  in close co operation and smoothly  
and almost before the other guests could turn to look  the unwelcome 

    



visitor was already in the street and could  if he were really mad  
dened  beat a few times with knife or stone on the roller bunds as 
the marks on it showed  but that was not a scandal in the hotel but 
in the street  a matter for the police who in any case always had a 
man on pattol in front of the hotel  it had never happened to milan  
as had been the case in other cafds  that the guest knocked anyone 
down or rushed through the rooms breaking tables and chairs or 
clung with arms and legs to the door so that afterwards not even a 
yoke of oxen could drag him away  milan never brought any ex  
cessive zeal or bad humour to his task  no love of fighting or personal 
prejudice  therefore he finished the matter swiftly and perfectly  a 
mmute after the expulsion he was back at his work m the kitchen or 
pantry as if nothing had happened  gustav only went  as if by 
chance  through the extrazimmer and looking at lotte  who sat at 
some table with the better guests  suddenly closed both eyes which 
meant that something had happened but that eveiything was now 
settled  then lotte  without stopping her conversation or ceasing to 
smile  also blinked quickly and imperceptibly  which meant  

 all right  thank you  keep an eye on it   

there remained only the question of what the expelled guest had 
drunk or broken  that sum lotte wrote off in gustav s accounts 
when they made up the accoimts for the day  which they did late at 
night behind a red screen  


    



xv 




t here were many ways by which the turbulent and skilfully 
expelled guest  if he were not immediately taken to prison 
from outside the hotel  could recover his spirits and his 
strength after the unpleasantness that had befallen him  he 
could totter to the kapia and refresh himself there in the cool breeze 
from the waters and the surrounding hills  or he could go to zanje s 
inn which was only a little farther on  in the main square  and there 
freely and without hindrance grind his teeth  threaten and curse the 
invisible hand that had so painfully and definitely thrown him out 
of the hotel  there  after the solid citizens and artisans who had only 
come to dnnk their  evening nip  or chat with their fellows had dis  
persed  there was no scandal  nor could there be  for everyone drank 
as much as he liked or as much as he could pay for  and everyone did 
and said what he liked  there was no question of asking a guest to 
spend money and drink up and at the same time behave as if was 
sober  though if anyone went beyond due measure there was always 
the solid and taciturn zanje himself whose scowling and bad  
tempered face discouraged even the most rabid drunkards and 
brawlers  he quietened them with a slow movement of his heavy 
hand and a few words in his gruff voice  

 hey you there  drop it  enough of your fun and games   

but even in that old fashioned inn where there were no separate 
rooms or waiters  for there was always some fellow or other from 
the sanjak to serve the drinks  new habits mingled wondrously with 
the old  

withdrawn into the farthest corners the notorious addicts of 
plum brandy sat silent  they were lovers of shadow and silence  sit  
ting over their plum brandy as if it were something sacred  hating 
movement and commotion  with burnt out stomachs  inflamed 
livers and disordered nerves  unshaven and uncared for  indifferent 
to everything else in the world and a burden even to themselves  they 
sat there and drank and  while drinking  waited until that magical 
light which shines for those completely given over to drink should 

i   



at last burst upon them  that joy for which it is sweet to suffer  to 
decay and finally to die  but which unfortunately appears more and 
more rarely and shines more and more weakly  

the most noisy and talkative were the beginners  for the most part 
sons of local worthies  young men in those dangerous years which 
mark the first steps on the road to ruin  paying that tribute which all 
must pay to the vices of drink and idleness  some for shorter  others 
for longer periods  most of them did not remain long on this road 
but turned away from it  founded families and devoted themselves to 
thrift and labour  to the daily life of a citizen with vices suppressed 
and passions moderated  only an insignificant minority  accursed 
and preordained  continued on that road forever  choosing alcohol 
instead of life  that shortest and most deceptive illusion in this short 
and deceptive life  they lived for alcohol and were consumed by it  
until they became sullen  dull and puffy like those who sat in the 
corners in the shadows  

since the new ways of life began  without discipline or considera  
tion  with more lively trade and better wages  as well as sumbo the 
gipsy who had accompanied all the townsmen s orgies for the past 
thirteen years with his zurla  or peasant clarinet  there now came 
often to the inn franz furlan with his accordion  he was a thin red  
dish man with a gold earring in his right ear  a woodcarver by pro  
fession  but too great a lover of wine and music  the soldiers and 
foreign workmen loved to listen to him  

it often happened that a guslar  a player on the one stringed fiddle  
could also be found there  usually some montenegrin  thin as a her  
mit  poorly dressed but proud in bearing  famished but ashamed  
proud but forced to accept alms  he would sit for some time in a 
comer  noticeably withdrawn  ordering nothing and looking straight 
in front of him  pretending to notice nothing and to be indifferent to 
everything  none the less it could be seen that he had other thoughts 
and intentions than his appearance revealed  within him wrestled 
invisibly many contrary and irreconcilable feelings  especially the 
contrast between the greatness that he felt in his soul and the misery 
and weakness of what he was able to express and reveal before 
others  therefore he was always a little confused and embarrassed  
proudly and patiently he waited for someone to ask for a song from 
him and then hesitantly took his gusle out of his bag  breathed on it  
looked to see if his bow had been slackened by damp  and tuned up  
all the while quite clearly wanting to attract as little attention as pos  
sible to these technical preliminaries  when he first passed the bow 
across the string it was still a wavering sound  uneven as a rutted 
road  but just as somehow or other one passes such a road  so he too 

    



through his nose with closed mouth began softly to accompany the 
sound and complete and harmonize it with his voice  when at last 
the two sounds merged into a single melancholy even note which 
wove an accompaniment for his song  the miserable singer changed 
as if by magic and all his troubled hesitation disappeared  his inner 
contradictions calmed and all his outer cares forgotten the guslar 
suddenly raised his head  like a man who throws off the mask of 
humility  no longer having need to conceal who and what he was  
and began unexpectedly in a strong voice his introductory verses  

 the sprig of basil began to weep  

o gentle dew  why fall you not upon me   

the guests  who until then had pretended not to notice and had 
been chatting together  all fell silent  at these first verses all of them  
turks and christians alike  felt the same shiver of undefined desire  
of thirst for that dew which lived in themselves as in the song  with  
out distinction or difference  but when immediately afterwards the 
guslar continued softly  

 but it was not the spng of basil        

and lifting the veil from his metaphor began to enumerate the real 
desires of turks and serbs concealed behmd these words of dew and 
basil  there arose divided feelings among the listeners which led 
them along opposing paths according to what each felt within him  
self and what each desired or believed but none the less  by some 
unwritten rule  they all quietly listened to the end of the song and  
patient and enduring  did not reveal their mood  but only looked 
into the glasses before them where  on the shining surface of the 
plum brandy  they seemed to see the victories so desired  the fights  
the heroes  the glory and the glitter  such as existed nowhere in the 
world  

it was liveliest in the inn when the younger men  sons of rich local 
worthies  sat down to drink then there was work for sumbo and 
franz furlan and corkan the one eyed and saha the gipsy  

saha was a squinting gipsy woman  a bold virago who  ank with 
anyone who could pay  but never got drunk  no orgy could be 
imagined without saha and her meaty jokes  

the men who made merry with them changed  but corkan  sumbo 
and saha were always the same  they lived on music  jokes and plum 
brandy  their work lay m the time wasting of others and their re  
ward in others  spendings  their true life was at night  especially in 
those unusual hours  s hen healthy and happy men are asleep  when 

i   



plum brandy and hitherto restrained instincts create a noisy and glit  
tenng mood and unexpected enthusiasms which are always the 
same yet seem always new and unimaginably beautiful  they were 
close mouthed paid witnesses before whom everyone dared to show 
himself as he really was  or in the local expression  to show the blood 
beneath the skin   without having afterwards either to repent or be 
ashamed  with them and in their presence everything was permitted 
which would be considered scandalous by the rest of the world and 
at home would be sinful and impossible  all these rich  respected 
fathers and sons of good families could  in their name and to their 
account  be for a moment what they did not dare show themselves  
at least at certain times and at least in a part of their bemg  the 
cruel could mock at them or beat them  the cowards could shout in  
sults at them  the prodigal could reward them generously  the vain 
bought their flattery  the melancholic and moody their jokes and 
pleasantries  the debauched their boldness or their services  they 
were an eternal but unrecognized need of the townsmen whose spiri  
tual lives were stunted and deformed  they were rather in the posi  
tion of artists m a milieu where art is unknown  there are always 
such people in a town  singers  jesters  buffoons  eccentrics  when 
one of them grew threadbare or died  another replaced him  for be  
sides the notorious and well known there developed fresh ones to 
shorten the hours and make gay the lives of new generations  but 
much time would have to pass before such another appeared as 
salko corkan the one eyed  

when  after the austrian occupation  the first circus had come to 
the town corkan had fallen in love with the tight rope walker and 
because of her had behaved so madly and eccentrically that he had 
been beaten and sent to prison  and the local worthies who had heed  
lessly led him astray and encouraged him to lose his head had had 
to pay heavy fines 

some years had passed since then  the people had grown accus  
tomed to many things and the arrival of strange players  clowns and 
conjurers no longer exated such universal and contagious sensa  
tion as had the first circus  but corkan s love for the dancer was still 
remembered  

for a long time he had wasted his strength in doing odd jobs by 
day and by night helping the local begs and rich men to forget their 
cares in drmking and brawling  so it went from generation to genera  
tion  as some sowed their wild oats and withdrew  got married and 
settled down  other and younger ones who wanted to sow theirs 
took their places  now corkan was washed out and old before his 
time  he was far more often in the inn than at work and lived not so 



much from what he earned as from free drinks and snacks given him 
by the customers  

on rainy autumn nights the guests in zarije s inn were overcome 
by boredom  their thoughts came slowly and were all concerned 
with melancholy and unpleasant matters  speech came with diffi  
culty and sounded empty and irritating  faces were cold  absent or 
mis trustful  not even plum brandy could enliven and improve their 
mood  on a bench in a corner of the inn corkan drowsed overcome 
by fatigue  the moist heat and the first glasses of plum brandy  it was 
raining cats and dogs  

then one of the sullen guests at the mam table mentioned  as if 
by chance  the dancer from the circus and corkan s unhappy love  
they all glanced at the corner but corkan did not budge and pre  
tended to go on dozing let them say what they liked  he had firmly 
decided that very morning  after a heavy night s drinking  not to 
reply to their jeering and mocking and not to let them play crude 
jokes on him as some of them had done the night before in that very 
inn  

 i believe that they still write to each other   said one  

 so you see  the bastard writes love letters to one while another is 
on her knees to him here   retorted another 

corkan forced himself to remain indifferent but the conversation 
irritated and excited him as if the sun were burning his face  his only 
eye seemed as if it forced itself to open and all the muscles of his face 
stretched into a happy laugh  he was no longer able to maintain his 
motionless silence  at first he waved his hand in a casual and indif  
ferent gesture and then said  

 all that is over  over long ago   

 all over  is it  what a wretch this fellow corkan is  one girl is 
pining away for him somewhere far away while another is going 
mad for him here  one is all over  this one here will soon be the 
same and then it will be the turn of a third  what sort of a fellow 
are you  you wretch  to turn their heads one after the other   

corkan leapt to his feet and approached the table  he had for  
gotten his drowsiness and fatigue and his decision not to be drawn 
into conversation  with hand on heart he assured the guests that it 
had not been his fault and that he was not so great a lover and 
seducer as they made out  his clothes were still damp and his face 
streaked and dirty  for the colour of his cheap red fez ran  but it 
was lighted up with a smile of alcoholic bliss  he sat down near the 
table  

 rum for corkani  shouted santo papo  a fat and greasy jew  son 
of mente and grandson of morde papo  leading hardware merchants  


    



corkan had recently begun to drink rum instead of plum brandy 
whenever he could get hold of it  the new drink was as if made for 
such as he  it was stronger  quicker m effect and pleasantly different 
from plum brandy  it came in small flasks of two decis each  with a 
label showing a young mulatto girl with luscious bps and fiery eyes 
with a wide straw hat on her head  great golden earrings and the in  
scription beneath  jamaica   that was something exotic for a bos  
nian in the last stages of alcoholism bordering on delirium it was 
made in slavonski brod by the firm of eisler  sirowatka and co   
when he looked at the picture of the young mulatto girl  corkan 
also felt the fire and aroma of the new drink and at once thought 
that he would never have been able to know this earthly treasure 
had he died even a year before  and how many such wonderful 
things there are in this world   he felt deeply moved at this thought 
and therefore always waited for a few pensive moments before he 
opened a bottle of rum  and after the satisfaction of that thought 
came the delight of the drink itself  

this time too he held the bottle before his face as if conversing 
with it unheard  but he who had first managed to draw him into 
conversation asked him sharply  

 why are you dreaming about that girl  you wretch  are you going 
to take her as your wife or play about with her as you did with all 
the others   

the girl in question was a certain pasa from du ce  she was the 
prettiest girl in the town  poor and fatherless  a seamstress as was 
also her mother  

during the countless picnics and drinkmg bouts of the past year 
the young bachelors had talked and sung much about pasa and her 
inaccessible beauty  listening to them corkan had gradually and im  
perceptibly become enthusiastic too  he himself did not know how 
or why  so they began to tease him about her  

one friday they took corkan with them for asikovanje  to flirt 
with the town girls in the turkish manner  when from tehind the 
courtyard gates or the window lattices muflied giggles could be heard 
and the whispering of the unseen girls  within  from one courtyard 
where pasa and her friends lived a sprig of tansy was thrown over 
the wall and fell at corkan s feet  he hesitated in confusion  not 
wanting to tread on the flower and undecided whether to pick it up  
the youths who had brought him clapped him on the back and con  
gratulated him that pasa had chosen him from so many and had 
shown him greater attention than anyone else had ever obtained 
from her  

that night they had gone drinking beside the river under the wal  



nut trees at mezalin and continued until dawn  corkan sat beside 
the fire  solemn and withdrawn  now joyous  now pensive  that 
night they would not let him serve the drinks or busy himself pre  
panng coffee and snacks  

 don t you know  fellow  the meaning of a sprig of tansy thrown 
by a girl   said one of them   it means that pa a is telling you  i am 
pining away for you like this plucked flower  but you neither ask 
for my hand nor allow me to go to another  that is what it means   

they all began to talk to him about pa a  so lovely  so chaste  
alone in the world  waiting for the hand that should pluck her  and 
that the hand for which she was waiting was corkan s and his alone  

they pretended to get angry and shouted loudly  how did she 
come to cast her eye on corkan  others defended him  as corkan 
went on drinking he came almost to believe in this marvel  only to 
reject it at once as an impossibility  in conversation he insisted that 
she was not the gurl for him  and defended himself against their jeers 
by saying that he was a poor man  that he was growing old and not 
very attractive  but in his moments of silence he let his thoughts 
dwell on pa a  her beauty and the joy that she would bring  heed  
less whether such joy were possible for him or not in that wonderful 
summer night which with the plum brandy and the songs and the 
fire burning on the grass seemed endless  everything was possible or 
at least not completely impossible  that the guests were mockmg 
and ridiculmg him he knew  gentlemen could not hve without 
laughter  someone had to be their buffoon  it always had been and 
always would be  but if all this were only a joke  his dream of a 
marvellous woman and an unattainable love  of which he had always 
dreamed and still dreamed today  was no joke  there was no joke 
in those songs in which love was both real and unreal and woman 
both near and unattainable as in his dream  for the guests all that 
too was a joke  but for him it was a true and sacred thing which he 
had always borne within himself and which had become real and 
indubitable  independent of the guests  pleasure  of vdne and of song  
of evorything  even of pasa herself  

all tliis he knew well and yet easily forgot  for his soul would 
melt and his mind flow like water  

so corkan  three years after his great love and the scandal about 
the pretty german tight rope walker  fell into a new and enchanted 
love and all the rich and idle guests found a fresh game  cruel and 
exciting enough to give them cause for laughter for months and 
years to come  

that was in midsummer  but autumn and winter passed and the 
game about corkan s love for the beautiful pasa filled the evenings 


    



and shortened the days for the merchants from the market place  
they always referred to corkan as the bridegroom or the lover  by 
day  overcome by the night s drinking and lack of sleep  when 
corkan did odd jobs m the shops  fetching and carrymg  he was sur  
prised and angered that they should call him so  but only shrugged 
his shoulders  but as soon as night came and the lamps were lit in 
zarije s inn  someone would shout  rum for corkan   and another 
sing softly as if by chance  

 evemns comes and the sim goes down 
on thy face it shines no longer        

then suddenly everything changed  no more burdens  no more shrug  
ging of shoulders  no more town or inn or even corkan himself as he 
was in reality  snuffling  unshaven  clothed in rags and cast off cloth  
mg of other men  there existed a high balcony lit by the settmg sun 
and wreathed in vines  with a young girl who looked for him and 
waited for the man to whom she had thrown a sprig of tansy  there 
was still  to be true  the coarse laughter around him and the crude 
jests  but they were all far away  as in a fog  and he who sang waj 
near him  close by his ear  

 if i could grow warm again 
in the sunlight that you bring me  

and he warmed himself in that sun  which had set  as he had never 
been warmed by the real sun which rose and set daily over the town  

 rum for corkan   

so the winter nights passed  towards the end of that winter pa a 
got married  the poor seamstress from du  e  in all her beauty of not 
quite nineteen years  married hadji omer who lived behind the fort  
ress  a rich and respected man of fifty five  as his second wife  

hadji omer had already been married more than thirty years  his 
wife came from a famous family and was renowned for her clever  
ness and good sense  their property behind the fortress was a whole 
settlement in itself  progressive and rich in everything his shops in 
the town were solidly built and his income assured and large  all 
this was not so much due to the peaceable and indolent hadji omer  
who did little more than walk twice a day to the town and back  as 
to his able and energetic  always smiling wife  her opinion was 
the last word on many questions for all the turkish women of the 
town  

his family was in every way among the best and most respected in 
the town  but the already ageing couple had no children  for long 

g     



they had hoped  hadji omer had even made the pilgrimage to mecca 
and his wife had made bequests to religious houses and given alms to 
the poor  the years had passed  everything had increased and pros  
pered  but m this one most important matter they had received no 
blessing  hadji omer and his good wife had borne their evil fortune 
wisely and well but there could be no longer any hope of children  
his wife was in her forty fifth year  

the great inheritance which hadji omer was to leave behind him 
was in question  not only his and his wife s numerous relations had 
concerned themselves in this matter  but to some extent the whole 
town also  some had wanted the marriage to remain childless to the 
end  while others had thought it a pity that such a man should die 
without heirs and that his goods should be dispersed among the many 
relations  and had therefore urged him to take a second  younger 
wife while there was still a chance of heirs  the local turks were 
divided into two camps on the question  but the matter was settled 
by the barren wife herself  openly  resolutely and sincerely  as in 
everything she did  she told her undecided husband  

the good god has given us everything  all thanks and praise to 
him  concorn and health and riches  but he has not given us what he 
gives to every poor man  to see our children and to know to whom 
to leave what shall remain after us  that has been my bad fortune 
but even if i  by the will of god  must bear this  there is no reason 
why you should do so  i see that the whole market place is concern  
ing itself with our troubles and urging you to marry again well  
since they are trying to marry you off  then it is i who want to 
arrange your marriage for you  for no one is a greater friend to you 
than l  

she then told him her plan  as there was no longer any likelihood 
that they two could ever have children  then he must bring to their 
home  beside her  a second wife  a younger one  by whom he might 
still be able to have children  the law gave him that right  she  natur  
ally  would go on living in the house as  the old hadjimca  and see 
that everything was done properly  

hadji omer long resisted and swore that he asked no better com  
panion than she  that he did not need a second wife  but she stuck to 
her opinion and even informed him which girl she had chosen  since 
he must marry in order to have children  then it were best that he 
take a young  healthy and pretty girl of poor family who would give 
him healthy heirs and  while she was alive  would be grateful for her 
good fortune  her choice fell on pretty pasa  daughter of the seam  
stress from dugje  

so it was done  at the wish of his older vdfe and with her assis  

    



tance  hadji omer married the lovely pa a and eleven months later 
pa a gave birth to a healthy boy  so the question of hadji omer s in  
heritance was settled  the hopes of many relations were extinguished 
and the mouths of the market place sealed  pasa was happy and  the 
old hadjinica  satisfied  and the two lived in hadji omer s house in 
concord like mother and daughter  

that fortunate conclusion of the question of hadji omer s heir 
was the beginnmg of corkan s great sufferings  that winter the pnn  
cipal amusement of the idle guests in   arije s inn was corkan s sor  
row at pasa s marriage  the imfortunate lover was drunk as he had 
never been before  the guests laughed till they cried  they all toasted 
him and each one of them got good value for his money  they 
mocked him with imaginary messages from pa a  assuring him that 
she wept night and day  that she was pming for him  not telling any  
one the real reason for her sorrow  corkan was m a frenzy  sang  
wept  answered all questions seriously and in detail and bewailed the 
fate which had created him so unprepossessing and poor  

 very well  corkan  but how many years younger are you than 
hadji omer   one of the guests would  gin the conversation  

 how do i know  and what good would it do me even if i were 
younger   corkan answered bitterly  

 eh  if   were to judge by heart and youth  then hadji omer would 
not have what he has  nor would our corkan be sitting where he is   
broke in another guest  

it did not need much to make corkan tender and sentimental  they 
poured him rum after rum and assured him that not only was he 
younger and handsomer and more suitable for pala but that  after 
all  he was not so poor as he thought or as he seemed  in the long 
nights these idle men over their plum brandy thought up a whole 
history  how corkan s father  an unknown turkish officer  whom no 
one had ever seen  had left a great property somewhere in anatolia 
to his illegitimate son in visegrad as sole heir  but that some relations 
down there had stayed the execution of the will  that now it would 
only be necessary for corkan to appear in the rich and distant city 
of brusa to counter the intrigues and lies of these false heirs and re  
cover what rightly belonged to him  then he would be able to buy 
up hadji omer and all his wealth  

corkan listened  went on drinking and only sighed  all that pained 
him but at the same time did not stop him from sometimes thmking 
of himself so  and behaving as a man who has been cheated and 
robbed both in this town and over there somewhere m a distant and 
beautiful land  the homeland of his supposed father  those around 
him pretended to make preparations for his journey to brusa  their 


    



jokes were long  cruel and worked out to the smallest detail  one 
night they brought him a supposedly complete passport  and with 
coarse jokes and roars of laughter pulled corkan into the centre of 
the mn and turned him round and exammed hun  m order to uiscribe 
his personal characteristics on it  another time they calculated how 
much money he would need for his trip to brusa  how he would 
travel and where he would spend his nights  that too passed a good 
part of the long night  

when he was sober corkan protested  he both believed and dis  
believed all he was told  but he disbelieved more than he believed  
when he was sober he believed  m fact  nothmg at all but as soon as 
he was drunk he behaved as though he believed it all  for when 
alcohol got a grip on him he no longer asked himself what was true 
and what was a lie  the truth was that  after the second little bottle 
of rum  he already seemed to feel the scented air from distant and 
unattainable brusa and saw  a lovely sight  its green gardens and 
white houses  he had been deceived  unfortunate in everything from 
birth  m his family  his property and his love  wrong had been done 
to him  so great a wrong that god and men were alike his debtors  
it was clear that he was not what he appeared to be or as men saw 
him  the need to tell all those around him tormented him more with 
every glass  though he himself felt how hard it was to prove a truth 
that was to him clear and evident  but against which cned out all 
that was in him and about him  after the first glass of rum  he ex  
plained this to everyone  all night long  in broken sentences and with 
grotesque gestures and drunkard s tears  the more he explained the 
more those around him joked and laughed  they laughed so long 
and heartily that then ribs and their jaws ached from that laughter  
contagious  irresistible and sweeter than any food or drink  they 
laughed and forgot the boredom of the winter night  and like 
corkan drank themselves silly  

 kill yourself   shouted mehaga sara  who by his cold and appar  
ently senous manner best knew how to provoke and excite corkan 
 since you have not been man enough to seize pa a from that weak  
ling of a hadji omer  then you oughtn t to live any longer  kill your  
self  corkan  that is my advice   

 kill yourself  kill yourself   wailed corkan   do you think i 
haven t thought of that  a hundred times i have gone to throw my  
self into the drina from the kapia and a hundred times something 
held me back   

 what held you back  fear held you back  full breeches  corkan   

 no  no  it was not fear  may god hear me  not fear   

in the general uproar and laughter corkan leapt up  beat his breast 

    



and tore a piece of bread from the loaf before him and thrust it under 
the cold and immobile face of mehaga  

 do you see this  by my bread and my blessing  it was not fear  
but       

suddenly someone began to hum in a low voice  

 on thy face it shines no longer 

everyone picked up the song and drowned mehaga s voice shout  
ing at corkan  

 kill     kill     your  self      f 

thus singing they themselves fell into that state of exaltation into 
which they had tried to drive corkan  the evening developed into a 
mad orgy  

one february night they had thus awaited dawn  driving them  
selves mad with their victim corkan  and themselves victims of his 
folly it was already day when they came out of the inn  heated with 
drink  with veins swollen and crackling  they went to the bridge 
which at the time was coated with a fine layer of ice  

with shouts and gusts of laughter  paying no heed to the few 
early passers by  they bet among themselves  who dares to cross the 
bridge  but along the narrow stone parapet shining under the thin 
coating of ice  

 corkan dares   shouted one of the drunkards 

 corkan  not on your life   

 who daren t  v i dare to do what no living man dares   shouted 
corkan beating his breast noisily  

 you haven t the guts  do it if you dare   

 i dare  by god   

 corkan dares   

 liar   

these drunkards and boasters shouted each other down  even 
though they could scarcely keep their feet on the broad bridge  stag  
gering  teetering and holding on to one another for support  

they did not even notice when corkan climbed on to the stone 
parapet  then  suddenly  they saw him floating above them and  
drunk and dishevelled as he was  begin to stand upright and walk 
along the flagstones on the parapet  

the stone parapet was about two feet wide  corkan walked along 
it swaying now left now right  on the left was the bridge and on the 
bridge  there beneath his feet  the crowd of drunken men who fol  
lowed his every step and shouted words at him which he scarcely 
understood and heard only as an incomprehensible murmur  and on 


    



the right a void  and in that void somewhere far below  the unseen 
river  a thick mist floated upwards from it and rose  like white smoke  
in the chill morning air  

the few passers by halted  temfied  and with wide open eyes 
watched the drunken man who was walking along the narrow and 
slippery parapet  poised above the void  waving his arms frantically 
to retain his balance  in that company of drunkards a few of the 
more sober who still had some commonsense watched the danger  
ous game  others  not realizing the danger  walked along beside the 
parapet and accompanied with their cnes the drunken man who 
balanced and swayed and danced above the abyss  

all at once  in his dangerous position  corkan felt himself 
separated from his companions  he was now like some gigantic mon  
ster far above them  his first steps were slow and hesitating  his 
heavy clogs kept slipping on the stones covered with ice  it seemed 
to him that his legs were failing him  that the depths below attracted 
him irresistibly  that he must shp and fall  that he was already falling  
but his imusual position and the nearness of great danger gave him 
strength and hitherto unknown powers  struggling to maintain his 
balance  he made more and more little jumps and bent more and 
more from his waist and knees  instead of walking he began to dance  
he himself did not know how  as free of care as if he had been on a 
wide green field and not on that narrow and icy edge  all of a sudden 
he felt himself light and skilful as a man sometimes is in dreams  his 
heavy and exhausted body felt without weight  the drunken 
corkan danced and floated above the depths as if on wings  he felt as 
if a gay strength flowed through his body which danced to an un  
heard music and that gave him security and balance  his dance bore 
him onward where his walk would never have borne him no longer 
thinking of the danger or the possibility of a fall  he leapt from one 
leg to the other and sang with outstretched arms as if accompanying 
himself on a drum  

tiridam  tiridam  tiritiritintiridam  tiridam  tiridam     

corkan sang and himself beat out the rhythm to which dancing 
surefootedly he made his dangerous crossing  his legs bent at the 
knees and he moved his head to left and right  

 tiridam  tiridam       hai       hai         

in that unusual and dangerous position  exalted above all the 
others  he was no longer corkan the one eyed  the butt of the town 
and the inn  below him there was no longer that narrow and slippery 

    



stone parapet of that familiar bridge on which he had countless times 
munched his bread and  thinking of the sweetness of death in the 
waves beneath  had gone to sleep in the shade of the kapia  

no  this was that distant and unattainable voyage of which they 
had spoken every night at the inn with coarse jokes and mockery and 
on which now  at last  he had set out  this was that glorious long  
desired path of great achievements and that in the distance at the 
end of it was the imperial city of brusa with its real riches and his 
legitimate heritage  the setting sun and the lovely pa a with his son  
his wife and his child  

so  dancing in a sort of ecstasy  he passed the parapet around the 
sofa and then the second half of the bridge  when he came to the 
end he leapt down and looked confusedly about him  in wonder that 
he had once again landed on the hard and familiar visegrad road  
the crowd which till then had accompanied him with encourage  
ment and jokes welcomed him  those who had halted in fear rushed 
up  they began to embrace him  to clap him on the back and on his 
faded fez  all of them shouted together  

 aferim  bravo  corkan  our falcon   

 bravo  hero   

 rum for corkanl  yelled santo papo in a raucous voice with a 
spanish accent  thinking that he was in the inn  

in this general uproar and commotion someone proposed that they 
stay together and not go home  but go on drinking in honour of 
corkan s exploit  

those children who were then in their eighth and ninth years and 
were that morning hurrying across the frozen bridge to their distant 
school stopped and stared at the unusual sight they opened their 
mouths in astonishment and little clouds of steam rose from them  
tiny  muffled up  with slates and schoolbooks under their arms  they 
could not understand this game of the grown ups  but for the rest of 
their lives they would remember  together with the lines of their 
own bridge  the picture of corkan the one eyed  that man so well 
known to them who now  transfigured and light  dancing daringly 
and joyously as if transported by magic  walked where it was for  
bidden to walk and where no one ever dared to go  


    



xvi 




a score of years had passed since the first yellow austrian 
military vehicles had crossed the bndge twenty years of 
occupation  that is a long sequence of days and months  
each such day and month  taken by itself  seemed uncertain 
and temporary  but all of them taken together constituted the 
longest period of peace and material progress that the town ever 
remembered  the mam part of the life of that generation which at 
the moment of the occupation had just come to years of discretion 

these were years of apparent prosperity and safe gains  even 
though small  when mothers spealdng of their sons said   may he 
live and be healthy and may god grant him easy bread    and when 
even the wife of tall ferhat  the eternal poor man  who lit the 
municipal street lamps and received for his work the wage of 
twelve florins a month  said with pride   thanks be to god  even 
my ferhat has become an official   

the last years of the nineteenth century  years without upheavals 
or important events  flowed past like a broad calm river before 
reaching its unknown mouth judging from them  it seemed as if 
tragic moments had ceased to disturb the life of the european 
peoples or that of the town beside the bridge  in so far as they 
took place now and again in the world outside  they did not 
penetrate to visegrad and were far off and incomprehensible to 
its townspeople  

thus  one summer day after so many years  there once more 
appeared on the kapia a white official notice  it was short and this 
time framed in a heavy black border  and announced that her 
majesty the empress elizabeth had died in geneva  the victim of 
a dastardly assassination by an italian anarchist  lucchieni  the 
announcement went on to express the disgust and profound sorrow 
of all the peoples of the great austro hungarian monarchy and 
called on them to rally still more closely around the throne in 
loyal devotion and thereby afford the greatest consolation to the 


    



ruler whom fate had so heavily bereaved  

the announcement was pasted up below the white plaque with 
the turkish inscription  as had at one time been the proclamation 
of general filipovi   about the occupation  and all the people read 
it with emotion since it concerned an empress  a woman  but 
without any real understanding or deep sympathy  

for a few evenings there were no songs or noisy gatheungs on 
the kapia by order of the authorities 

there was only one man in the town whom this news deeply 
affected he was pietro sola  the only italian in the town  a con  
tractor and builder  stone mason and artist  in short a man of all 
tasks and the specialist of the town maistor pero  as the whole 
town called him  had come at the time of the occupation and had 
remained in the town  marrying a certain stana  a poor girl of 
not too savoury a reputation she was reddish  powerful  twice as 
big as maistor pero and was considered a woman of sharp tongue 
and heavy hand with whom it was better not to quarrel  maistor  
pero himself was a small  bent  good natured man with mild blue 
eyes and pendent moustaches he worked well and earned much  
in time he had become a real townsman only  like lotte  he was 
never able to master the language and the pronunciation  because 
of his skilful hands and gentle nature he was loved by the whole 
town and his athletically powerful wife led him through life 
strictly and maternally  like a child 

when  returning home from work grey with stone dust and 
streaked with paint  maistor pero read the announcement on the 
kapia  he pulled his hat down over his eyes and feverishly bit 
on the thin pipe w hich was always between his teeth he explained 
to the more serious and respected citizens whom he met that he  
although an italian  had nothing in common with this lucchieni 
and his dastardly crime the people listened to him  consoled him 
and assured him that they believed him and that  furthermore  
they had never even thought anything of the sort about him  none 
the less  he went on explaining to everyone that he was ashamed 
to be alive  that he had never even killed a chicken in his life 
how much less a human being  and that a woman and so great a 
personage  in the end his timidity became a real mania  the towns  
people began to laugh at maistor pero s worries  his zeal and his 
superfluous assurances that he had nothing m common with 
anarchists and murderers the urchins of the town at once made 
up a cruel game  hidden behind some fence they would shout at 
maistor pero   lucchieni   the poor devil defended himself from 
these shouts as from a swarm of wasps  pulled his hat down over 


    



his eyes and fled home to bewail his fate and weep on the broad 
lap of his stana 

 i am ashamed  i am ashamed  sobbed the little man  can t 
look anyone m the face  

 get along  you old fool  what have you to be ashamed of  that 
an italian has murdered the empress  let the italian king be ashamed 
of that  but who are you and what have you done to be ashamed of   

 i am ashamed to be alive   wailed maistor pero to the woman  
who shook him and tried to instil a little strength and resolution 
into him and to teach him to walk through the market place with 
head held high  not lowering his gaze before anyone 

meanwhile the older men sat on the kapia with stony faces and 
downcast looks and listened to the most recent news  with details 
of the murder of the austrian empress  the news was no more 
than an excuse for a discussion on the fate of crowned heads and 
great men  surrounded by a group of respectable  inquisitive and 
unlettered turkish merchants  the visegrad schoolmaster hussein 
effendi was holding forth on who and what were anarchists  

the schoolmaster was just as stiff and solemn  clean and neat  
as he had been twenty years before when awaiting the arrival of 
the first schwabes with mula ibrahim and pop nikola  both of 
whom had long been lying in their respective graveyards his beard 
was already grey but just as carefully trimmed and rounded  his 
whole smooth face calm and peaceful  for men with a rigid under  
standing and hard heart age slowly  the high opinion which he 
had always had of himself had grown even greater in these last 
twenty years it may be said in passing that the case of books 
on which his reputation as a learned man rested to a great extent 
was still largely unread  and his chronicle of the town had grown 
in these twenty years by four pages only  for the older the school  
master grew he esteemed himself and his chronicle more and more 
and the events around him less and less  

now he spoke in a low voice  slowly as if reading from some 
obscure manuscript and in a dignified manner  solemnly and 
severely  using the fate of the infidel empress only as a pretext 
which did not in any way enter into the real sense of his inter  
pretation  according to this interpretation  and that too was not 
his own  for he had found it in the good old books inherited from 
his one time teacher  the famous arap hod a  those now known 
as anarchists had always existed and would always exist while 
the world lasted  human life was so ordered  and god  the one  
the merciful and compassionate  had so ordained  that for every 
dram of good there were two  ams of evil and there could be 


    



no goodness on this earth without hatred and no greatness without 
envy  even as there was not even the smallest object without its 
shadow that was particularly true of famous people  beside each 
one of them  alongside their glory  was also their executioner 
waiting for his chance and who seized it  sometimes earlier  some  
times later  

take for example our countryman mehmed pasha who has long 
been in paradise   said the schoolmaster and pointed to the stone 
plaque above the proclamation   who served three sultans and was 
wiser than asaf and who by his power and piety erected even 
this stone on which we are sitting and who too died by the knife  
despite all his power and wisdom he was unable to escape his 
appointed hour those whom the grand vezir hindered in their 
plans  and they were a great and powerful party  found a way to 
arm and suborn a mad dervish to  kill him  and that just at the 
moment when he was entering the mosque to pray with his shabby 
dervish cloak on his back and a rosary in his hand the dervish barred 
the way of the vezir s suite and humbly and hypocritically asked 
for alms  and when the vezir was about to put his hand in his 
pocket to give them to him  the dervish stabbed him  and so 
mehmed pasha died as a martyr to the faith   

the men listened and blowing the smoke of their cigarettes far 
from them looked now at the stone plaque with the mscnption  
now at the white placard bordered by a black line they listened 
attentively  though not one of them fully understood every word 
of the schoolmaster s interpretation but  looking through their 
cigarette smoke into the distance  beyond the inscription and the 
placard  they seemed to see somewhere in the world another and 
different life  a life of great ascents and sudden falls  in which 
greatness mingled with tragedy and which m some manner main  
tained a balance with this peaceful and monotonous existence of 
theirs on the kapia  

but those days passed too  the old order returned to the kapia 
with its usual loud conversations  jokes and songs discussions 
about anarchists ceased  the announcement of the death of that 
foreign and little known empress changed under the influence of 
sun  rain and dust until at last the wind tore it away and it floated 
in fragments down river into the void  

for a little longer the ragamuffins of the town shouted 
 lucchieni  after maistor pero without knowing themselves what 
they meant nor why they did so  but solely from that childish 
need to tease and torment weak and sensitive creatures they 
shouted  and then ceased to shout having found some other amuse  


    



ment  stana of mejdan contributed not a little to this result by 
mercilessly beating two of the most obstreperous of the urchins  

after a couple of months no one mentioned the empress s death 
or anarchists any longer that life at the end of the century  which 
seemed tamed and domesticated for ever  concealed everything 
beneath its wide and monotonous course and left among men the 
feeling that a century was opening of peaceful industry leading 
into some distant and unattainable future  

that unceasing and irresistible activity to which the foreign 
administrators seemed condemned and with which the townspeople 
were with difficulty reconciled  though they had just this to 
thank for their livelihood and their prosperity  changed many 
things in the course of those twenty years  in the outward appear  
ance of the town and in the costume and habits of its citizens  
it was natural that it would not stop short of the ancient bridge 
which looked eternally the same  

it was in       the close of that happy century and the beginning 
of the new  which in the feelings and opinions of many was to be 
even happier  that engineers came to examine the bridge the 
people were already accustomed to such things  even the children 
knew what it meant when these men in leather overcoats  with 
breast pockets stuffed with varicoloured pencils  began to prowl 
about some hill or some building it meant that something would be 
demolished  built  dug up or changed only no one was able to 
imagine what they could be doing with the bridge which to every 
living soul in the town meant a thing as eternal and unalterable as 
the earth on which they trod or the skies above them but the 
engineers inspected it  measured it and took notes  then they went 
away and the matter was forgotten but about midsummer  when 
the river was at its lowest  contractors and workmen suddenly 
began to arrive and erect temporary lean tos to store their tools 
near the bridge  already the rumour spread that the bridge was 
to be repaired  and complicated scaffolding was erected near the 
piers and on the bridge itself windlass lifts were set up  by their 
help the workers moved up and down the piers as on some narrow 
wooden balcony and stopped at places where there was a hok 
or wheie tufts of grass had grown out of the stonework  

every hole was plugged  the grasses plucked out and the birds  
nests removed  when they had finished this task  work began on 
the waterlogged foundations of the bridge  the current was checked 
and its course altered so that the blackened and corroded stone 
could be seen  together with an occasional oak beam  worn away 
but petrified by the waters in which it had been placed     years 

    



before  the indefatigable lifts lowered cement and gravel  load 
after load  and the three central piers which were the most exposed 
to the strong current and the most corroded were filled in at the 
bases as a rotten tooth is filled at its root  

that summer there were no sessions on the kapia and the 
customary life around the bridge was suspended  the bridge was 
crowded with horses and carts bringing sand and cement  the 
shouts of the workmen and the orders of the foremen echoed 
from all sides on the kapia itself a wooden toolshed was erected  

the townsmen watched the work on the great bridge  astonished 
and perplexed  some made a jest of it  others only waved their 
arms and went their way  and to all of them it seemed that the 
foreigners were doing this work  as they did all other work  only 
because they must work at something  work for them was a 
necessity and they could not do otherwise no one said this  but 
everybody thought it  

all those who had been accustomed to pass their time on the 
kapia now sat outside lotte s hotel  zarije s inn or in front of the 
wooden door shutters of the shops near the bridge  there they 
drank coffee and told stories  waiting until the kapia should be 
free again and that attack on the bridge should pass  as a man 
waits for the end of a shower or some other inconvenience  

in front of alihodja s shop which was sandwiched between the 
stone han and zarije s inn  where the bridge could be seen from 
an angle  two turks sat from early morning  two hangers on in 
the market place  chatting about everything and more especially 
about the bridge  

alihodja listened to them in ill humoured silence  pensively 
watching the bridge which was swarming with workmen hke ants  

in those twenty years the hodja had married three times  now 
he had a wife much younger than himself and malicious tongues 
said that that was the reason he was always ill humoured until 
noon  by these three wives he had fourteen children  his house 
was filled with a noisy crowd all day long and in the market place 
they said in jest that the hodja did not know all his own children 
by name  they even told a story of how one of his numerous brood 
met the hodja in a sidestreet and took his hand to kiss it  but the 
hodja only stroked his head and asked   god give you good health  
son  and whose may you be   

to the eye the hodja had not changed greatly  only he was now 
plumper and redder in the face  he no longer moved so briskly and 
went home up that steep slope to mejdan more slowly than before  
for his heart had been troubling him for some time  even when 


    



he was asleep he had therefore gone to the district doctor  dr 
marovski  the only one of the newcomers whom he recognized 
and respected  the doctor gave him some drops which did not 
cure his ills  but helped him to bear them  and from him ahhodja 
learnt the latm name for his complaint  angina pectoris  

alihodja was one of the few local turks who had accepted 
none of the novelties and changes which the newcomers had 
brought  either in dress  in customs  m speech or m methods of 
trade and business with that same bitter obstmacy with which 
he had at one time stood out against useless resistance  he had 
for years stood out against everything that was austrian and foreign 
and against everything that was gathering impetus around him  for 
that reason he sometimes came into conflict with others and had 
had to pay fines to the police  now he was a little tired and 
disillusioned  but he was essentially just the same as he had been 
when he had argued with karamanh on the kapia  obstinate in 
everything and at all times  save that his proverbial freedom of 
speech had turned to sharpness and his fightmg spmt into a sullen 
bitterness which even the most daring words could not express 
and which was calmed and extinguished only in silence and in 
solitude  

with time the hodja had fallen more and more into a sort of 
calm meditation in which he had no need of anyone else and found 
all men hard to endure everyone  the idle merchants of the market  
place  his customers  his young wife and all that horde of urchins 
which filled his house with noise  irritated him  before the sun 
rose he fled from his house to his shop which he opened before 
any of the other merchants  there he earned out his mommg 
devotions  there his lunch was brought to him  and when  dunng 
the day  conversation  visitors and business bored him  he put up 
the wooden shutters and withdrew into a tiny closet behmd the 
shop which he called his coffin  that was a secret place  narrow  
low and dark  the hodja almost filled it when he crawled in  
he had there a small stool covered with a rug on which he 
could sit with crossed legs  a few shelves with empty boxes  old 
scales and all sorts of rubbish for which there was no room in 
the shop  in that narrow dark hole the hodja could hear through 
the thin walls of his shop the hum of life in the market place  the 
sound of horses  hooves and the cries of the sellers  all that came 
to him as from another world  he could hear too some of the 
passers by who stopped before his closed shop and made malicious 
jokes and comments about him  but he listened to them calmly  
for to him these men were dead and had not realized it  he knew 


    



and foigot them in the same moment  hidden behind those few 
planks  he felt himself completely protected from all that this life 
could bring him  this life which in his opinion had long become 
rotten and proceeded along evil ways there the hodja shut himself 
in with his thoughts on the destiny of the world and the course 
of human affairs  and forgot all else  the market place  his worries 
about debts and bad tenants  his too young wife whose youth and 
beauty had suddenly turned into a stupid and malicious ill humour  
and that brood of children which would have been a heavy burden 
on an emperor s treasury and about which he thought only with 
horror  

after he had recovered his spirits and rested there  the hodja 
would again take down his shutters as if he had just come back 
from somewhere 

so now he listened to the empty chatter of his two neighbours  

tou see now how the times are and the gifts of god  time eats 
away even stone like the sole of a shoe  but the schwabes will not 
have it so and at once mend what is damaged   philosophized one 
of them  a well known lazybones from the market place  as he 
sipped alihodja s coffee  

 while the drina is the drina the bridge will be the bridge 
even if they had not touched it  it would last its appointed time 
all this expense and all this trouble will serve them nothing   said 
the other guest  of the same occupation as the first  

they would have dragged on their idle chatter indefinitely had not 
alihodja interrupted  

 and i tell you that no good will come of their interfering with 
the bridge  you will see  nothing good will come of all this restora  
tion  what they repair today they will tear down again tomorrow  
the late lamented mula ibrahim used to tell me that he had learnt 
from ancient books that it is a great sin to meddle with living 
water  to turn its course aside or change it  were it even for a 
day or an hour  but the schwabes do not feel themselves alive 
unless they are hammenng or chiselling something or other  they 
would turn the whole world upside down if they could   

the first of the idlers tried to show that  when all was said and 
done  it was not so bad that the schwabes should repair the 
bridge  if it did not prolong its life it would at any rate do it 
no harm  

 and how do you know that they will do it no harm   the hodja 
broke in angnly   who told you  don t you know that a single 
word can destroy whole cities  how much more then such a babel  
all this earth of god s was built upon a word  if you were literate 


    



and educated  as you are not  then you would know that this is 
not a building like any other  but one of those erected by god s 
will and for god s love  a certain ume and certain men built it  
and another time and other men will destroy it  you know what 
the old men say about the stone han  there was none other like 
it m the empire yet who destroyed it  had it been a question 
of its solidity and the skill of its construction it would have lasted 
a thousand years  yet it has melted away as if it had been made 
of wax and now on the place where it was the pigs grunt and 
the schwabes  trumpet sounds   

 but  as i think  i believe       the idler replied  

tou believe wrongly   interrupted the hodja   according to your 
ideas nothing would ever have been built and nothing destroyed 
that has never occurred to you  but i tell you that all this is not 
good  it foretells evil  for the bridge and for the town and for 
all of us who are looking at it with our own eyes   

 he is right  the hodja knows best what the bridge is   broke in 
the other idler  maliciously recallmg alihodja s one time martydom 
on the kapia  

 you needn t think that i don t know   said the hodja with con  
viction and at once began  quite calmly to tell one of his stories 
at which the townsfolk used to mock  but to which they loved 
to listen time and time again  

 at one time my late lamented father heard from sheik dedqe and 
told me as a child how bridges first came to this world and how the 
first bridge was built  when allah the merciful and compassionate 
first created this world  the earth was smooth and even as a finely 
engraved plate  that displeased the devil who envied man this gift 
of god  and while the earth was stul just as it had come from god s 
hands  damp and soft as unbaked clay  he stole up and scratched the 
face of god s earth with his nails as much and as deeply as he could  
therefore  the story says  deep rivers and ravines were formed which 
divided one distnct from another and kept men apart  preventing 
them from travelling on that earth that god had given them as a 
garden for their food and their support  and allah felt pity when he 
saw what the accursed one had done  but was not able to return to 
the task which the devil had spoiled with his nails  so he sent his 
angels to help men and make things easier for them  when the angels 
saw how unfortunate men could not pass those abysses and ravines 
to finish the work they had to do  but tormented themselves and 
looked in vain and shouted from one side to the other  they spread 
their wings above those places and men were able to cross  so men 
learned from the angels of god how to build bridges  and therefore  

    



after fountains  the greatest blessing is to build a bridge and the 
greatest sin to interfere with it  for every bridge  from a tree trunk 
crossing a mountain stream to this great erection of mehmed pasha  
has its guardian angel who cares for it and maintams it as long as god 
has ordained that it should stand   

 so it is  so it is  by god s will   the two idlers marvelled humbly  

so they passed their time m conversation  as the days passed and 
the work went on there on the bridge  whence they could hear the 
squeakmg of carts and the pounding of machines mixing sand and 
cement  

as always  in this discussion too  the hodja had the last word  no 
one wanted to press an argument with him to the end  least of all 
those two idle and empty headed fellows who drank their coffee 
there and knew well that the next day also they would have to pass 
a good part of their long day in front of his shop  

so alihodja talked to everyone who stopped  fore the shutters of 
his shop  whether on business or just making a call  they all listened 
to him with mocking curiosity and apparent attention  but no one in 
the town shared his opinions or had any understanding of his pessi  
mism or his forebodings of evil  which he himself was unable to ex  
plain or to support by proof  furthermore they had for long been 
accustomed to look on the hodja as an eccentric and an obsunate 
man who now  under the influence of npening years  difficult cn   
cumstances and a young wife  saw the black side of everything and 
gave everything a speaal and ill omened significance  

the townspeople were  for the most part  indifferent to the work 
on the bridge  as they were towards everything which the new  
comers had been doing for years in and about the town  only the 
children were disappointed when they saw that the workmen with 
their wooden ladders went in through that black opening in the cen  
tral pier  that  room  in which by universal childish belief the arab 
lived  from this place the workmen brought out and tipped into the 
nver countless baskets of birds  droppings  and that was all  the 
arab never appeared  the children made themselves late for school  
waiting vainly for hours for the black man to emerge from his dark  
ness and strike the first workman in his path  strike him so strongly 
that he would fly from his moving scaffolding in a great curve into 
the river  they were furious that this had not happened  and some 
of the urchins tried to say that it had happened already  but they did 
not sound convincing and all their  words of honour  were to no 
purpose  

as soon as the repair work on the bridge was finished  work began 
on a water supply  till then the town had had wooden fountains of 


    



which only two on mejdan gave pure spring water  all the others  
down on the level  were connected with water from the drina or the 
rzav and ran cloudy whenever the water of those two rivers was 
cloudy  and dried up altogether during the summer heats when the 
nver level fell  now engineers found that this water was unhealthy  
the new water was brought right from the mountains on the other 
side of the drina  so that the pipes had to be taken across the bndge 
into the town  

once again there was noise and commotion on the bndge  flag  
stones were raised and a channel dug for the conduits  fires burnt on 
which pitch was boiled and lead melted  hemp was plaited mto 
ropes  the townspeople watched the work with distrust and 
curiosity as they had always done before  alihodja was irritated by 
the smoke which drifted across the square to his shop  and spoke dis  
dainfully of the  new  unclean water which passed through iron 
pipes so that it was not fit to drink or for ablutions before prayer 
and which not even horses would drmk if they were still of the good 
old breed that they once were  he laughed at lotte who brought the 
water into her hotel  to everyone willmg to listen he proved that the 
waterworks were only one of the signs of the approaching evil which 
sooner or later would fall upon the town  

however  next summer  the water supply was installed  even as so 
many earlier works had been introduced and completed clean and 
abundant water  which was no longer dependent either on drought 
or flood  flowed into the new iron fountains  many brought the water 
into their courtyards and some even into their houses  

that same autumn the building of the railway began  that was a 
much longer and more important task at first it did not seem to have 
any connection with the bridge  but that was only apparent  

this was the narrow gauge railway described in newspaper 
articles and official papers as the  eastern railway   it was to link 
sarajevo with the serbian frontier at vardiste and the boundary of 
the turkish held sanjak of novi pazar at uvce  the line ran right 
through the town which was the most important station on it  

much was said and written about the political and strategic signi  
ficance of this line  of the impending annexation of bosnia and her  
zegovma  of the further aims of austro hungary through the sanjak 
to salonica and all the complicated problems connected with them  
but in the town all these things still seemed completely innocent and 
even attractive  there were new contractors  fresh hordes of work  
men and new sources of gain for many  

this time everything was on a grand scale  the building of the 
new line      kilometres long  on which were about     bridges and 


    



viaducts and about     tunnels  cost the state seventy four million 
crowns  the people spoke of this great number of millions and then 
looked vaguely into the far distance as if trying in vam to see there 
this great mountain of money which went far beyond any calcula  
tion or imagining   seventy four nulhons   repeated many of them 
knowingly as if they could count them on the palm of their hand  
for even in this remote little town where life in two thirds of its 
forms was still completely oriental  men began to become enslaved 
by figures and to believe in statistics   somethmg less than half a mil  
lion  or to be accurate            crowns per kilometre   so the 
people filled their mouths with big figures but thereby neither be  
came richer nor wiser  

during the building of the railway  the people for the first time 
felt that the easy  carefree gains of the first years after the occupation 
existed no longer  for some years past the prices of goods and every  
day necessities had been leaping upward  they leapt upward but 
never fell back and then  after a shorter or a longer period  leapt up 
again it was true there was still money to be made and wages were 
high  but they were always at least twenty per cent less than real 
needs  this was some mad and artful game which more and more 
embittered the lives of more and more people  but m which they 
could do nothing for it depended on something far away  on those 
same unattainable and unknown sources whence had come also the 
prosperity of the first years  many men who had grown rich immed  
iately after the occupation  some fifteen or twenty years before  were 
now poor and their sons had to work for others  true  there were 
new men who had made money  but even in their hands the money 
played like quick silver  like some spell by which a man might easily 
find himself with empty hands and tarnished reputation  it became 
more and more evident that the good profits and easier life which 
they had brought had their counterpart and were only pieces in some 
great and mysterious game of which no one knew all the rules and 
none could foresee the outcome  and yet everyone played his part 
in this game  some with a smaller some with a greater role  but all 
with permanent risk  

in the summer of the fourth year the first train  decorated with 
green branches and flags  passed through the town  it was a moment 
of great popular rejoicing  the workmen were served with a free 
luncheon with great barrels of beer  the engineers had their pictures 
taken around the first locomotive  all that day travel on the railway 
was free   one day free and a whole century for money   mocked 
alihodja at those who took advantage of this first train   

only now  when the railway had been completed and was work  


    



ing  could it be seen what it meant for the bridge and its role in the 
life of the town  the line went down to the drma by that slope be  
low mejdan  cut into the hillside  arcumvented the town itself and 
then went down to the level ground by the farthest houses near the 
banks of the rzav  where the station was all traffic  both passengers 
and goods  with sarajevo and beyond sarajevo to the rest of the wes  
tern world  now remained on the right bank of the drina  the left 
bank  and with it the bridge  was completely paralysed  only those 
from the villages on the left bank now went across the bridge  
peasants with their httle overburdened horses and bullock carts 
or wagons dragging timber from distant forests to the station  

the road which led upwards from the bridge across lijeska to 
semed and thence across the glasinac and romania ranges to 
sarajevo  and which had at one time echoed to the songs of the 
drovers and the clatter of packhorses  began to be overgrown with 
grass and that fine green moss which gradually accompanies the de  
cline of roads and buildings  the bridge was no longer used for 
travellmg  farewells were no longer said on the kapia and men no 
longer dismounted there to dnnk the stirrup cups of plum brandy 
 for the road   

the packhorse owners  their horses  the covered carts and little 
old fashioned fiacres by which men at one time travelled to sarajevo 
remained without work  the journey no longer lasted two whole 
days with a halt for the night at rogatica  as up till now  but a mere 
four hours  that was one of those figures which made men stop and 
think  but they still spoke of them without understanding and with 
emotion  reckoning up all the gains and savings given them by speed 
they looked with wonder at the first townsmen who went one day 
to sarajevo  finished their business  and returned home again the 
same evening  

alihodja  always mistrustful  pig headed  plain spoken and apart 
in that as in all else  was the exception  to those who boasted of the 
speed with which they could now finish their business and reckoned 
how much time  money and effort they had saved  he replied ill  
humouredly that it was not important how much time a man saved  
but what he did with it when he had saved it  if he used it for evil 
purposes then it had been better he had never had it  he tried to prove 
that the main thing was not that a man went swiftly but where he 
went and for what purpose and that  therefore  speed was not always 
an advantage  

 if you are going to hell  then it is better that you should go slowly   
he said curtly to a young merchant  ton are an imbecile if you think 
that the schwabes have spent their money and brought their machine 


    



here only for you to travel quickly and finish your business more 
conveniently  all you see is that you can ride  but you do not ask 
what the machine brings here and takes away other than you your  
self and others like you  that you can t get into your head  ride then  
my fine fellow  ride as much as you like  but i greatly fear that all 
your riding will lead only to a fall one of these fine days  the time 
will come when the schwabes will make you ride where you don t 
want to go and where you never even dreamt of going   

whenever he heard the engine whistle as it rounded the bends on 
the slope behind the stone han  alihodja would frown and his lips 
would move in incomprehensible murmurs and  looking out slant  
wise from his shop at the unchanging bridge  he would go on 
elaborating his former idea  that the greatest buildings are founded 
by a word and that the peace and existence of whole towns and their 
inhabitants might depend upon a whistle  or so at least it seemed to 
this weakened man who remembered much and had grown sud  
denly old  

but in that as in all else alihodja was alone in his opinions like an 
eccentric and a dreamer  in truth the peasants too found it hard to 
grow accustomed to the railway  they made use of it  but could not 
feel at ease with it and could not understand its ways and habits 
they would come down from the mountains at the first crack of 
dawn  reaching the town about sunrise  and by the time they reached 
the first shops would begin asking everyone they met  

 has the machine gone   

 by your life and health  neighbour  it has gone long ago   the idle 
shopkeepers lied heartlessly  

 really gone   

 no matter there ll be another tomorrow   

they asked everyone without stopping for a moment  hurrying 
onwards and shouting at their wives and children who lagged behind 

they arrived at the station running one of the railwaymen re  
assured them and told them that they had been misinformed and that 
there were still three good hours before the departure of the train  
then they recovered their breath and sat down along the walls of 
the station buildings  took out their breakfasts  ate them  and chatted 
or dozed  but remained continually alert  whenever they heard the 
whistle of some goods engine they would leap to their feet and 
bundle their things together  shouting  

 get up  here comes the machine   

the station official on the platform cursed them and drove them 
out again  

 didn t i just tell you that it was more than three hours before the 

    



train comes  what are you rushing for  have you taken leave of 
your senses   

they went back to their old places and sat down once more  but 
still suspicious and distrustful  at the first whistle or even only at 
some uncertain noise they once more leaped to their feet and crowded 
on to the platform  only to be repulsed once more to wait patiently 
and listen attentively  for however much the officials told them and 
explained to them  they could not get it into their heads that the 
 machine  was not some sort of swift  mysterious and deceitful con  
traption invented by the schwabes which slipped away from anyone 
inattentive enough to wink an eye and which had only one idea in its 
mind  how to cheat the peasant and leave without him  

but all these things  the peasants  stupidity and alihodja s bad  
tempered grumbling  were things of no importance  the people 
laughed at them and at the same time soon grew accustomed to the 
railway as they had to everything else that was new  easy and 
pleasant  they still went out to the bridge and sat on the kapia as 
they had always done  and crossed it on their everyday affairs  but 
they travelled in the direction and manner imposed on them by the 
new times  quickly and easily they grew reconciled to the idea that 
the road across the bridge no longer led to the outside world and 
that the bridge was no longer what it once had been  the link between 
east and west better to say  most of them never thought about it  

but the bridge still stood  the same as it had always been  with the 
eternal youth of a perfect conception  one of the great and good 
works of man  which do not know what it means to change and 
grow old and which  or so it seemed  do not share the fate of the 
transient things of this world  


    



xvii 




b ut there  beside the bridge  m the town bound to it by fate  
the fruits of the new times were ripening  the year      
brought with it great uneasiness and a sort of obscure threat 
which thenceforward never ceased to weigh upon the town  
in fact this had begun much earlier  about the time of the building 
of the railway line and the first years of the new century  with the 
rise in prices and the incomprehensible but always perceptible fluc  
tuations of government paper  dividends and exchanges  there was 
more and more talk of politics  

till then the townspeople had concerned themselves exclusively 
with what was near to them and well known  with their gains  their 
pastimes and  in the mam  only with questions of their family and 
their homes  their town or their religious community  but always 
directly and within definite limits  without looking much ahead or 
too far into the past  now  however  more and more frequently in 
conversation questions arose which lay farther away  outside this 
narrow circle in sarajevo religious and national organizations and 
parties were founded  serbian and moslem  which immediately set 
up their sub committees in vi egrad  new papers were started in 
sarajevo and began to arrive in the town  reading rooms and choral 
societies were founded  first serbian  then moslem and finally jewish  
students from the secondary schools and the universities at vienna 
and prague returned to their homes in the vacations and brought 
with them new books  pamphlets and a new manner of expression  
by their example they showed to the younger townsfolk that they 
did not always have to keep their mouths shut and keep their 
thoughts to themselves as their elders had constantly believed 
and affirmed  names of new organizations began to come into 
the conversation  religious and national  on wide bases and with 
bold aims  and finally workers  organizations also  then the 
word  strike  was heard in the town for the first time  the young 
apprentices became more serious  in the evenings on the kapia 
they carried on conversations incomprehensible to others and ex  

    



changed little paper backed pamphlets with such titles as   what is 
socialism     eight hours of work  eight hours of rest  eight hours of 
self improvement  and  aims and ways of the world proletariat   

there was talk to the peasants on the agranan problem  the rela  
nons between serfs and landowners  of turkish feudal landholding  
the peasants listened  looking a little aside with imperceptible move  
ments of their moustaches and little frowns  as if trying to remember 
all that was said in order to think it over later  either alone or m dis  
cussion with their fellows  

there were plenty of citizens who continued to keep a discreet 
silence and who rejected such novelties and such boldness of thought 
and language  but there were many more  especially among the 
younger ones  the poor and the idle  who accepted all this as a joyful 
confirmation which corresponded to their inner needs long kept 
silent  and brought into their lives that something great and exciting 
which had up till then been lacking  when reading speeches and 
articles  protests and memoranda issued by party or religious organi  
zations  each one of them had the feeling that he was casting off 
chains  that his horizon was widening  his thoughts freed and his 
forces linked with those of men more distant and with other forces 
never thought of until then  

now they began to look at one another from a point of view they 
had never before taken in short  it seemed to them  in this matter 
also  that their life had become more expansive and richer  that the 
frontiers of the impermissible and the impossible had moved back 
and that there opened before them prospects arid possibilities such 
as had never before existed  even for him who until then had never 
possessed them  

in actual fact  even now they had nothing new nor were they able 
to see anything better  but they were able to look beyond the every  
day life of the town  and that gave them the exciting illusion of 
space and power  their habits had not changed  their ways of life 
and the forms of mutual relations remained the same  only that in 
the time honoured ritual of sitting idly over coffee  tobacco and 
plum brandy  bold words and new methods of conversation had 
been introduced  men began to leave their old associates and form 
new groups  to be repelled or attracted according to new criteria and 
new ideas  but under the stress of old passions and ancestral instincts 

now too  external events began to find their echo in the town  
first there were the dynastic changes of      in serbia and then the 
change of rdgime in turkey  the town which was right on the 
serbian frontier and not far from the turkish boundaries  linked by 
deep and invisible bonds to one or other of these two lands  felt these 


    



changes  lived them and interpreted them  although nothing of all 
that was thought and felt about them was ever said publicly or talked 
of openly  

the activities and pressure of the authorities began to be felt more 
openly in the town  first the civil authorities and then the military as 
well  and that in quite a new form  at first they had paid attention to 
who did what and how he behaved  and now they inquired about 
who thought what and how he expressed his opinions  the number 
of gendarmes in the surrounding villages along the frontier was 
gradually increased  a special information officer  a man from the 
lika  arrived at the local headquarters  the police arrested and fined 
youths for imprudent declarations or for singing prohibited serbian 
songs  suspected foreigners were deported  and differences of opinion 
led to arguments and quarrels among the citizens themselves  

with the introduction of the railway travelling became quicker 
and the transport of goods easier  and somehow at about the same 
time events too quickened their pace the townspeople did not notice 
this  for the quickening was gradual and all of them were involved 
in it  they became accustomed to sensations  exciting news was no 
longer something rare and unusual but an everyday food and a real 
need  the whole of life seemed to be hastening somewhere  suddenly 
speeded up  as a freshet quickens its pace before it breaks into rapids  
rushes over steep rocks and becomes a cascade  

only four years had passed since the arrival of the first train in the 
town when  one october morning  a huge white proclamation was 
posted on the kapia  beneath the plaque with the turkish inscrip  
tion  it was put up by the municipal official drago  at first only the 
idlers and children gathered round it and then  later  the rest of the 
citizens  those who knew how to read deciphered the proclamation  
spelling it out and halting at the foreign expressions and unfamiliar 
phrasing  the others listened in silence and with downcast eyes and 
after listening for a while dispersed without looking up  stroking 
their beards and moustaches as if to brush away words which had 
never been spoken  

after the noon prayer alihodja too came  placing a bar across his 
shop front as a sign that the shop was closed  this time the proclama  
tion was not written in turkish also  so that the bodja could not read 
it  a boy was reading the proclamation aloud  quite mechanically  
as if at school  

 proclamation 
to the people of bosnia and herzegovina  

 we  franz joseph  emperor of austria  king of bohemia etc  and 
apo apo apo stolic king of hungary  to the inhabitants of bosnia and 


    



herzegovina  when a gen gener generation ago our annies crossed 
the frontiers of your lands      

alihodja felt his nght ear tingling beneath his white turban and  
as if it had been the day before  his quarrel with karamanli flashed 
before his eyes  the outrage then committed on him  the red cross 
which swam before his eyes filled with tears  while the austrian 
soldier carefully extracted the nail  and the white placard with the 
proclamation then addressed to the people  

the youth went on  

 an ass ass assurance was then given you that they had not come 
as enemies but as your friends with the avowed intention of rooting 
out all the evils which had for years op op oppressed you  

 that word given to you in that crit critical moment        

everyone shouted at the inexpert reader who  blushing and em  
barrassed  slipped away into the crowd  in his place came some im  
known man in a leather jacket  who seemed as if he were only wait  
ing for his chance  who began to read quickly and fluently as if it 
were a prayer that he already knew by heart  

 that word given to you in that critical moment has been honestly 
kept  our government has always seriously concerned itself and 
worked to maintam peace and order  to lead your fatherland to  
wards a happier future  

 and we  to our great joy  dare freely to say the seed which has 
been sown in the furrows of the soil so prepared has produced a nch 
harvest  you too must feel those facts as a blessing  that in place of 
violence and tyranny have come order and security  that work and 
life have developed continuously  that the ennobling influence of its 
work has multiplied opportunities for culture and that under the 
protection of a regular administration every man may enjoy the 
fruits of his labours  

 it is the solemn duty of all of us to continue along this way  

 having this aim constantly before our eyes  we hold that the 
time has come to give the inhabitants of these two lands a fresh proof 
of our faith in their political maturity  in order to raise bosnia and 
herzegovina to a higher level of political life  we have decided to 
grant constitutional institutions  such as will answer to their pre  
sent conditions and their common interests  to both these lands and 
to give in this manner a legal basis for the representation of their 
wishes and interests  

 let your voices also be heard when in the future decisions will 
be made touching the affairs of your country which will have have  
as it has had up till now  its separate administration  

 but the first necessary condition for the introduction of this 


 i  



national constitution is the clear and indubitable definition of the 
legal position of both these lands  starting from this principle and 
bearing in mind those bonds which in olden times existed between 
our glorious predecessors on the throne of hungary and these lands  
we extend our rights of sovereignty over bosnia and herzegovina 
and we desire that these lands accept the order of succession which 
is valid for our house 

thus the inhabitants of both lands will become participators in 
all these benefits which will assure them the lasting consolidation 
of those bonds which  up to the present  have linked them to us  the 
new state of affairs will be the guarantee that culture and prosperity 
will continue to find a sure home in your country  

 bosnians and herzegovinians  

 among the countless cares which surround our throne  that 
which we shall have for your material and moral prosperity will not 
be the least  the supreme conception of the equality of all before 
the law  the participation in the making of laws and the administra  
tion of the country  an equal protection afforded to all faiths  
languages and national characteristics  all these supreme benefits 
you will enjoy in full measure  

 the freedom of the individual and the good of the community 
will be the guiding star of our government for both these lands        

with mouth half open and head lowered  alihodja listened to 
these words  for the most part unfamiliar or unknown to him  and 
even those words which were not of themselves unfamiliar became 
in that context in some manner queer and incomprehensible   seed 
      sown in the furrows of the soil so prepared       first and neces  
sary condition for the introduction of this local constitution  clear 
and indubitable definition of legal position       guiding star of our 
government   yes  those were the  imperial words  once again  each 
one of them opened before the hod a s inner vision now some dis  
tant  extraordinary and dangerous horizon  now some sort of cur  
tain which fell  black and leaden  j ust before his eyes  so  first one 
thing and then the other  either he saw nothing or he saw something 
that he did not understand and which presaged no good  in this life 
nothing is impossible and every wonder possible it could even hap  
pen that a man might listen carefully and yet understand nothing in 
detail while at the same time  when all those details were taken to  
gether  he could realize completely and understand perfectly  that 
seed  that star  those cares about the throne  all those things might 
just as well have been in some foreign language  yet none the less 
the hodja  or so it seemed to him  could understand what they were 
intended to mean and what they wished to convey  these emperors 


    



had for the past thirty years shouted across the lands and aties and 
over the heads of the peoples  yet every word in every proclamation 
of every emperor was pregnant with meanmg  for these countries 
were broken into fragments and in these countries heads rolled be  
cause of these words  so they spoke of  seed       stars       cares of the 
throne  lest they call things by their real names and speak what was 
the fact  that lands and provinces and  with them  living men and 
their habitations passed from hand to hand like small change  that a 
well intentioned true believing man could no longer find peace on 
this earth  no more than he could find the little he needed for this 
short life  that his position and his goods changed independently of 
himself and contrary to his wishes and his best intentions  

alihodja listened and he had continually the impression that these 
words were the same words of thirty years ago  he felt the same 
leaden heaviness in his breast  the same message that the turkish 
times were ended and that  the turkish candle was burned out   but 
that it was necessary to repeat them for they would not understand 
or realize them  but deceived themselves and pretended to know 
nothing of them  

 you will therefore show yourselves worthy of the confidence 
placed in you  so that the noble harmony existing between ruler and 
people  that most precious gage of all state progress  will always 
accompany our common labours 

 given in our royal and capital city of budapest  

franz joseph   

the man in the leather jacket suddenly ceased reading and 
shouted unexpectedly  

 long live his majesty the emperor   

 long life   shouted tall ferhat  the municipal lamplighter  as if by 
order  

all the others dispersed at the same moment in silence  

before dark that day the great white proclamation was tom down 
and thrown into the drina  the next day some serbian youths were 
arrested on suspicion and a fresh copy of the white proclamation 
was put up on the kapia and a local gendarme posted there to guard 
it  

whenever a government feels the need of promising peace and 
prosperity to its citizens by means of a proclamation  it is time to 
be on guard and expect the opposite  towards the end of october  the 
army began to arrive  not only by train but also along the old deserted 
road  as it had done thirty years before  it came down the steep 
slope from sarajevo and crossed the bridge into the town  with arms 
and commissariat  there were units of all kinds except cavalry  all 


    



the barracks were full  they camped under canvas fresh units were 
continually arriving  stayed a few days m the town and were then 
posted to the villages along the serbian frontier  the soldiers were 
mainly reservists  of vanous nationalities  with plenty of money  
they made their minor personal purchases in the shops and bought 
fruit and sweetmeats at the street corners  prices leapt  hay and oats 
completely disappeared  fortifications began to be built on the hills 
surrounding the town and on the bridge itself a very strange task 
began  in the middle of the bridge  just beyond the kapia as one came 
from the town to go to the left bank of the drina  workmen specially 
brought for the job began to drill a hole about a yard square in one 
of the piers  the spot where they worked was concealed under a 
green tent  from beneath which continual hammering could be 
heard as they went deeper and deeper  the stone excavated was at 
once thrown over the parapet into the river  but however much the 
work was concealed  it was soon known in the town that the bridge 
was being mined  that is to say that a deep opening was being dug 
through one of the piers  right to the foundations  and that explosives 
would be placed in it in case war broke out and it was found neces  
sary to destroy the bridge long iron ladders led down into the open  
ing and when everything was finished an iron manhole cover was 
placed over it  within a few days this cover could no longer be dis  
tinguished from the stones and dust  carts passed over it  horses 
trotted by  and the townsmen hurried on their business without 
giving a thought to the mine and the explosives beneath  only the 
children on their way to school halted for a moment at this spot  
tapped inquisitively at that iron cover  trying to guess what was be  
neath it  they made up tales of some arab hidden in the bridge  and 
argued among themselves about what an explosive was  what it did 
and whether it could ever destroy so  eat a building  

among the grown ups  only ahhodja prowled around and gazed 
sombrely and suspiciously both at the green tent while the work was 
going on and at the iron cover which remained on the bndge after it 
had been finished  he listened to all that was said or whispered  that 
a hole as deep as a well had been made in that pier and explosives 
placed in it  and that it was connected by an electrical lead to the 
bank so that the commandant could at any time of the day or night 
destroy the bridge right in the middle as though it were made of 
sugar and not of stone  the hodja listened  shook his head  thought it 
over by day when he retired to his  coffin  and by night in bed when 
he should have been asleep  now he believed  now he rejected such 
an idea as mad and godless  but he worried about it continually so 
that even in his sleep the one time mutevehs of mehmed pasha s 


    



vakuf appeared before him and asked him severely what all this was 
and what were they doing to the bndge  he turned his troubles over 
and over in his mind  he did not want to ask anyone in the market  
considenng that for a long time past there had been no one with 
whom a sensible man could consult or converse reasonably  since all 
the people had either lost their senses and their reputations or were 
 ust as embittered and confused as he himself was  

none the less  he soon found an opportunity to learn more about 
it  one of the brankovid begs from crn e  muhamed  who had done 
his army service in vienna  had stayed there as a long service man 
and been promoted to sergeant major  he was the grandson of that 
shemsibeg who after the occupation had shut himself up in crnce 
and died of sorrow  and who was still quoted by the older turks as 
an unattainable example of moral grandeur and logic   muhamed  
beg had that year come home on leave  he was a big tall man of red  
dish complexion  dressed in an impeccable dark blue uniform with 
yellow rank badges  red piping and little silver stars on his lapel  
with white kid gloves on his hands and red fez on his head  
courteous  smiling  irreproachably clean and neat  he walked in the 
market place  his long sword tapping gently on the cobbles  greet  
ing everyone amiably and confidently like a man who has eaten 
the bread of the emperor  who has no doubt of his own importance 
or any reason to be afraid of others  

when this muhamed beg came to his shop  asked about his health 
and sat down to drink a cup of coffee  alihodja took the opportunity 
of asking him  as an  imperial man  who lived far from the town  for 
an explanation of the cares that oppressed him  he told him what 
the trouble was  what had been done on the bridge and what they 
were saying in the town  and asked him if such a thing were possible 
and whether they could plan the destruction of a bequest of such 
universal benefit as this one  

as soon as he had heard what was in question  the sergeant major 
suddenly became serious  his broad smile disappeared and his ruddy 
clean shaven face took on a wooden expression as if he were on 
parade at the moment of the command  attention  he was silent for 
a moment as if in indecision and then replied in a sort of hushed 
voice  

 there is something in all you say  but if you really want my ad  
vice  then it is best not to inquire about this or speak of it  for it 
comes under the head of military preparedness  official secrets and 
so forth and so on   

the hodja hated all the new expressions and especially that  and 
so forth and so on   it was not only that the words grated on his ears  


    



but he felt clearly that  in the speech of these strangers  it took the 
place of an unspoken truth and that all that had been said before 
meant nothing at all  

 in the name of god  don t stuff me up with their        and so forth 
and so on   but tell me and explain  if you can  what they are doing 
to the bridge  there can be no secret about that  in any case what 
sort of a secret is that  if even the schoolchildren talk about it   the 
hodja interrupted angrily   what has the bridge to do with their war   

 it has  ahhodja  it has very much to do with it   said brankovid  
once again smiling  

and he explained to alihodja amiably but a little condescendingly  
as if speaking to a child  that all this was provided for in the rules of 
the service  that this was the duty of engineers and bridge builders  
and that in the imperial army everyone knew only his own job and 
did not concern himself in the affairs of some other branch  

the hod a listened to him  listened and watched  but did not under  
stand very much finally  he could no longer hold himself in  

 all that is very fine  my fine fellow  but do they know that this is 
a vezir s bequest  built for the good of his soul and the glory of god 
and that it is a sin to take even a stone from it   

the sergeant major only waved his hands  shrugged his shoulders  
pursed his lips and closed his eyes  so that his whole face assumed a 
crafty and obsequious expression  unmoving  blind  deaf  such as 
men can only achieve by long years of practice in old fashioned and 
decaying administrations in which discretion has long degenerated 
into insensibility and obedience into cowardice  a page of white un  
sullied paper is eloquent compared with the dumb caution of such a 
face  a moment later  the emperor s man opened his eyes  let fall his 
hands  composed his face and once again resumed his usual appear  
ance of confidence and serenity in which viennese good humour and 
turkish courtesy met and mingled like two waters  changing the sub  
ject and praising with well chosen words the hodja  s health and 
youthful appearance  he took his leave with the same inexhaustible 
amiability with which he had come  the hodja remained confused 
and uncertain in himself but in no way less troubled than he had 
been before  lost in his thoughts he looked out from his shop at the 
shining loveliness of that first day of march  opposite him  a little 
to the side  stood the eternal bridge  everlastingly the same  through 
its white arches could be seen the green  sparkling  tumultous waters 
of the drina  so that they seemed like some strange diadem in two 
colours which sparkled in the sun  


    



xviii 




t he tension known to the outside world as  the annexation 
crisis   which had thrown its ill omened shadow over the 
bridge and the town beside it  rapidly subsided  somewhere 
out there  by diplomacy and discussions between the 
mterested parties  a peaceful solution had been found  

the frontier  always so inflammable  for once did not flare up  
the army which had filled the town and the frontier adllages in the 
first days of spring began to withdraw  but as always the changes 
which the crisis had brought remained after it had passed  the per  
manent garrison in the town was much larger than it had been be  
fore  the bridge remained mined but no one gave it a thought ex  
cept alihodja mutevelid  the piece of land on the left flank of the 
bridge above the ancient retaining wall  which had been the town 
park  was taken over by the military authorities  the fruit trees in 
the centre of the park were cut down and a fine building erected 
that was the new officers  mess  for the former mess  a small one  
storied building up at bikavac  was now too small for the increased 
number of officers  so that now  on the right of the bridge was lotte s 
hotel and on the left the officers  mess  two white almost identical 
buildings and between them the square  surrounded by shops and  
on a small rise above the square  the great barracks which the people 
still called the stone han in memory of mehmed pasha s caravan  
serai which had once been there but had now disappeared without 
trace  

prices  which had leapt up the previous autumn because of the 
large number of soldiers  remained unchanged  with much greater 
likelihood of further rises than of returning to their former level  
that year a serbian and a moslem bank were opened  the people 
made use of money orders like medicines  now everybody incurred 
debts more freely  but the more money a man had the more he 
needed only to those who spent more than they gained did life seem 
easy and good  but the merchants and business men were worried  
terms of payment become shorter than ever  good and reliable cus  


    



tomers were fewer and fewer  the number of articles whose price 
was higher than the people could afford to pay was ever greater  
business was on a small scale  and cheaper and cheaper types of goods 
were in demand only bad payers bought freely  the only sure and 
safe business was army contracting or work for some government 
institution  but not everyone could get it  state taxes and municipal 
dues became larger and more numerous  the strictness of the collec  
tors increased  one could feel from afar the unhealthy fluctuations 
of the exchanges  the profits which arose from them went into un  
seen hands  while the losses reached even the most remote corners 
of the monarchy and struck the retail traders  both as sellers and 
consumers  

the general feeling in the town was neither more serene nor more 
calm  that sudden slackening of tension did not result in a real 
appeasement either among the serbs or the moslems  it left to the 
first a concealed disillusionment  to the second distrust and fear of 
the future  the expectation of great events began to grow once more  
without visible reason or direct cause  the people hoped for some  
thing or were afraid of something  in actual fact some hoped while 
others feared  and looked on everything in the light of those hopes 
and fears  in a word  men s hearts were disturbed  even among the 
simple and illiterate  especially among the younger people  and no 
one was any longer satisfied with the monotonous sort of life which 
had dragged on for years  everyone wanted more  asked for better or 
trembled m fear of worse  the older people still regretted that  sweet 
tranquillity  which in turkish times had been regarded as the main 
aim of existence and the most perfect expression of public and pri  
vate life  and which had still existed in the first decades of the aus  
trian administration  but there were few of these  all the others de  
manded an animated  noisy and exciting life  they wanted sensations 
or the echo of sensations or at least variety  noise and excitement 
which would give the illusion of sensation  that desire changed not 
only the state of men s minds but even the external appearance of 
the town  even that time honoured and established life on the kapia  
that life of quiet conversation and peaceful meditations  simple jokes 
and lovesick songs between the waters  the sky and the mountains  
began to change  

the coffee merchant obtained a gramophone  a clumsy wooden 
box with a big tin trumpet in the shape of a bright blue flower  his 
son changed the records and the needles and was continually wind  
ing this raucous contraption which echoed from both banks and 
made the kapia quiver  he had been forced to get it in order not to 
be left behind by his competitors  for now gramophones could be 

h     



heard not only at meetings and m the reading rooms but even in the 
humblest cafes where the guests sat under a lime tree  on the grass or 
on brightly ht balconies  and talked with few words and in low 
voices everywhere the gramophone ground and churned out 
turkish marches  serbian patriotic songs or arias from viennese 
operettas  according to the tastes of the guests for whom it played  
for men would no longer go where there was neither noise  glitter 
nor movement  

newspapers were read avidly  but superficially and hastily  every  
one looked only for the sensational news printed m large type on the 
front page  there were few who read the articles or the news in small 
type all that took place was accompanied by clamour and the bril  
liance of big words  the younger people did not think that they had 
lived that day if by the evening their ears were not singing or their 
eyes had not been dazzled by what they had heard or seen in the 
course of the day  

the agas and esendis of the town came to the kapid  serious and 
outwardly indifferent  to listen to the latest news about the turco  
italian war in tripoli  they listened avidly to all that was written 
in the papers about the heroic young turkish major  enver bey  who 
beat the italians and defended the sultan s lands like a descendant 
of the sokollis or the kuprulus  they frowned at the raucous music 
of the gramophone  which prevented their thinking  and  without 
showing it  trembled deeply and sincerely for the fate of the distant 
turkish province in africa  

it chanced that just then pietro the italian  maistor pero  return  
ing from work clothed in his linen overall  white with stone dust 
and stained with paint and turpentine  crossed the bridge  he had 
grown old and bent and even more humble and timid  as at the time 
when lucchieni assassinated the empress  it seemed  by some logic 
incomprehensible to him  that he was again guilty of something 
which his italian fellow countrymen  with whom for many years 
he had had no contact  had done somewhere in the outer world  one 
of the turkish youths shouted  

 so you want tripoli  you bastard  you there  i mean   and made 
obscene gestures at him  

but maistor pero  bent and tired  with his tools under his arm  only 
pulled his hat further over his eyes  feverishly bit on his pipe stem 
and hurried home to mejdan 

there his stana was waiting for him she too had grown older 
and had lost some of her physical strength  but she was still a for  
midable and outspoken woman  he complained bitterly to her about 
the young turks who said things they should not have said and had 

    



asked him about tripoli  which until a few days ago he had not even 
known existed but stana  as always  would not understand him or 
console him  but went on saying that it was he himself who was at 
fault and even deserved to have insults shouted at him  

 if you were a real man  which you are not  you would have hit 
their ugly phizzes with your chisel or your hammer  then those 
ragamuffins would not even think of jeering at you but would get 
to their feet when you cross the bridge   

 eh  stana  stana   said maistor pero good humouredly and a little 
sadly   how could a man hit another in the face with a hammer   

so those years passed in a succession of greater or lesser sensations  
or m the constant need of them so it came to the autumn of       
then      with the balkan wars and the serbian victories  by a 
strange exception  just these things which were of such great im  
portance to the fate of the bridge and the town and all who lived in 
it came silently and almost unnoticed  

flushed with red at sunrise and sunset  golden at midday  the 
october days passed over the town  which was waiting for the maize 
crop and the new season s plum brandy  it was still pleasant to sit on 
the kapia in the noonday sun  time  it seemed  was holding its breath 
over the town it was just then that it happened 

even before the literates in the town could find their way through 
the contradictory newspaper reports  the war between turkey and 
the four balkan states had already broken out and followed the well  
worn paths across the balkans before the people had fully grasped 
the sense and import of this war it was practically over as a result of 
the victories of the serbian and christian armies  all was ended far 
from visegrad  without fires on the frontiers  without the grumble 
of the guns and without heads on the kapia  as it had been with trade 
and money  so it was with those more important things also  every  
thing happened far away and unbelievably quickly  somewhere far 
away in the world the dice had been thrown  the battles fought  and 
it was there that the fate of each one of the townsfolk was decided  

but if the outward appearance of the town remained peaceful and 
imchanged  these events stirred up in the minds of men whole tem  
pests of the greatest enthusiasm and the deepest depression  as in the 
case of everything else that had happened in the world in recent 
years  they were looked on in the town with diametrically opposed 
feelings by the serbs and the moslems  only in their intensity and 
depth were they perhaps equal  these events surpassed all the hopes 
of the one  all the fears of the others appeared justified  those desires 
which for hundreds of years had flown before the slow pace of his  
tory could now no longer keep pace with it but outdistanced it by 


    



some fantastic flight along the road to the most daring realization 

everything that the town could see or feel directly of that fateful 
war took place inciedibly simply and with the swiftness of an 
arrow  

at uvce where the frontier between austro hungary and turkey 
followed the little river uvac  and where a wooden bridge separated 
the austrian gendarmerie barracks from the turkish blockhouse  the 
turkish officer with his small guard crossed to the austrian side  
there  he broke his sword with a theatrical gesture on the parapet 
of the bridge and surrendered to the austrian gendarmes  at that 
moment the grey clad serbian infantry came down from the hills 
they replaced the old fashioned askers along the whole frontier be  
tween bosnia and the sanjak  the triangle between austria  turkey 
and serbia disappeared the turkish frontier which only the day be  
fore had been about nine miles from the town was suddenly with  
drawn more than     miles  somewhere far beyond jedrene 
 adnanople   

so many and such important changes  earned out in so short a 
time  shook the town to its foundations  

for the bridge on the drina this change was fateful  the railway 
link with sarajevo had  as we have seen  reduced its connection with 
the west and now  in a moment  its connection with the east also 
ceased  in fact the east  which had created it and which had up to 
the day before still been there  greatly shaken and weakened no 
doubt  but still as permanent and real as sky and land  had now 
vanished like an apparition  now the bridge in reality no longer 
linked anythmg save the two parts of the town and those dozen or 
so villages on one or the other side of the dnna 

the great stone bridge which  according to the ideas and the pious 
intentions of the grand vezir from sokolovidi  was meant to link the 
two parts of the empire  and  for the love of god  make easier the 
passage from west to east and from east to west  was now in fact 
cut off from both east and west and abandoned like a stranded ship 
or a deserted shrine for three whole centuries it had endured and 
experienced everything and  unchanging  had truly served its pur  
pose  but human needs had altered and world conditions changed  
now its task had betrayed it  by i s size  its solidity and its beauty  
armies might pass across it and caravans follow one another for cen  
turies to come  but thus  by the eternal and unforeseen play of human 
relations  the vezir s bequest suddenly found itself abandoned and  
as if by some magic spell  outside the main stream of life  the present 
role of the bridge in no way corresponded to its eternally young 
appearance and its gigantic but harmonious proportions  but it still 

    



stood the same as when the grand vezir had seen it in his inward 
vision behind closed eyes and as when his masons had built it  power  
ful  beautiful and enduring  beyond all possibility of change  

it needed time  it needed effort  before the townspeople understood 
all that has been said here in a few lines and what had in fact taken 
place in a few months  not even in dreams did frontiers change so 
quickly or go so far away  

all that had lain quiescent in men  as ancient as that bridge and 
equally dumb and motionless  now suddenly came alive and began 
to influence their everyday life  their general mood and the personal 
fate of every individual 

the first summer days of      were rainy and oppressive  on the 
kapia by day sat the moslems of the town  morose and disconsolate  
about a dozen elderly men grouped around a younger one who read 
to them from the newspapers  interpreting foreign expressions and 
unusual names and explaining the geography  all smoked peacefully 
and gazed unwaveringly in front of them but could not completely 
conceal that they were anxious and shaken  hiding their emotion  
they bent over the map which showed the future partition of the 
balkan peninsula they looked at the paper and saw nothing in those 
curving lines  but they knew and understood everything  for their 
geography was in their blood and they felt biologically their picture 
of the world  

 who will get uskub  skoplje    asked one old man  apparently in  
differently  to the youth who was reading 

 serbia   

 uh   

 and who will get salonica   

 greece   

 uh  uh   

 and jedrene   asked another in a low voice  

 bulgaria  probably   

 uh  uh  uh   

these were not loud and mournful wailings  like women or weak  
lings  but deep and stifled sighs which were lost with the tobacco 
smoke which drifted through their moustaches into the summer air 
many of these old men had passed their seventieth year in their 
childhood  the turkish power had stretched from the lika and the 
kordun right to stambul and from stambul to the uncertain desert 
frontiers of far off and illimitable arabia  that turkish power 
had been the great  indivisible and indestructible unity of the moslem 
faith  all that part of the terrestrial globe where the muezzin called 
the faithful to prayer   they remembered that well  but they also 


    



remembered how  later on  in the course of their lives  that turkish 
power had withdrawn from serbia into bosnia and then from bosnia 
into the sanjak  and now  now they lived to see that power hke 
some fantastic ocean tide suddenly withdraw and pass away some  
where far out of sight  while they remained here  deceived and 
menaced  like seaweed on dry land  left to their own devices and 
their own evil fate  all this came from god and was  without doubt  
envisaged in the ordinances of god  but it was hard for men to under  
stand  their breath came short  their consciousness was troubled  
they felt as if the solid earth was being drawn irresistibly away from 
under their feet as if it were a carpet  and how frontiers which should 
have been firm and lasting had become fluid and shifting  moving 
away and lost in the distance hke the capricious rivulets of spring  

with such thoughts and feelings the old men sat on the kapia and 
listened vaguely to all that the newspapers wrote  they listened 
silently though the words in which the papers spoke of kingdoms 
and states seemed to them mad  impudent and out of place  and their 
whole manner of writing as something godless  contrary to the eter  
nal laws and the logic of life  something which would  get no better  
and with which no decent or honourable man could become recon  
aled above their heads floated clouds of tobacco smoke  and in 
the skies cruised white  fleecy clouds of a rainy summer  casting 
quick broad shadows on the earth  

at night on the kapia youths from the serbian houses sat till the 
small hours  singing loudly and provocatively the song about the 
serbian gun and no one came to fine or punish them  amongst them 
could often be noticed students from the universities or secondary 
schools  they were mostly thin  pale youths with long hair and black 
shallow hats with wide brims  that autumn they came very often  
though the school year had already commenced  they came by train 
from sarajevo with instructions and recommendations  passed the 
night here on the kapia  but were no longer in the town at dawn 
next day for the young men of visegrad sent them on by under  
ground routes to serbia  

with the summer months  at the time of the school holidays  the 
town and the kapia became lively with schoolboys and students  
born in the town and returning to their homes  they influenced the 
whole life of the tovra  

at the end of june a group of students from the sarajevo secon  
dary school arrived in the town and in the first half of july students 
of law  medicine and philosophy from the universities of vienna  
prague  graz and zagreb  began to arrive one by one  with their 
arrival even the outward aspect of the town began to change  their 

    



young faces could be seen in the market place and on the kapia and 
they were easily distinguishable by their bearing  their speech and 
their clothes from the established customs and unchanging clothing 
of the townspeople  they wore clothes of dull colours and the latest 
cut  this was the  glockenfagon  then considered the height of 
fashion and the best of taste in all central europe  on their heads 
they wore soft panama hats with turned down brims and ribbons of 
six different but discreet colours  on their feet wide american shoes 
with sharply turned up toes most of them carried very thick bamboo 
canes and in the lapels of their coats they wore metal sokol badges 
or those of some student organization  

the students brought with them new words and jokes  new dances 
from the balls of the previous winter  and especially new books and 
pamphlets  serbian  czech and german  

it had happened earlier too  m the first years of the austnan occu  
pation  that young men from the town had gone away to study  but 
not in such large numbers nor inspired by this sort of spirit  in those 
first few decades a few of them had finished at the teachers  train  
ing college at sarajevo  and two or thiee had even read philosophy 
at vienna  but these had been rare exceptions  modest youths who 
had passed their examinations quietly and without advertisement 
and once their studies had been completed had been lost in the grey 
and countless ranks of the state bureaucracy but for some time past 
the number of students from the town had suddenly increased  by 
the help of national cultural institutions even peasants  sons and the 
children of petty artisans went to the university the spirit and 
character of the students themselves changed  

these were no longer those one time students of the first years 
after the occupation  mild and timid youths devoted to their studies 
in the closest sense of the word  but neither were they the ordinary 
town dandies and goodfellows of an earlier time  future landowners 
and shopkeepers who at a certain period in their lives wasted their 
excess of youth and strength on the kapia till their families said of 
them   marry him off and stop his squalling   these were a new sort 
of young men  educated in various cities and states and under various 
influences  from the great cities  from the universities and schools 
which they attended  these young men came back intoxicated with 
that feeling of proud audacity with which his first and incomplete 
knowledge fills a young man  and carried away by ideas about the 
rights of peoples to freedom and of individuals to enjoyment and 
dignity  with every summer vacation they brought back with them 
free thinking views on social and religious questions and an 
enthusiastically revived nationalism which recently  especially after 

    



the serbian victories in the balkan wars  had grown to a universal 
conviction and  in many of these youths  to a fanatical desire for 
action and personal sacrifice  

the kapia was the main scene of their meetings they would meet 
there after supper  in the darkness  under the stars or in the moon  
light  above the boisterous river  echoed their songs  jests  noisy con  
versation and endless arguments  new  bold  naive  sincere and unself  
conscious 

with the students were also their childhood friends who had 
studied with them in the local elementary school  but had remained 
in the town as apprentices  shop assistants or clerks in the municipal 
offices  there were two types  some were satisfied with their destiny 
and the life of the town in which they would pass their days  they 
looked with curiosity and sympathy at their educated comrades  ad  
mired them and never thought of comparing themselves with them  
and  without the slightest jealousy  followed their development and 
their career  there were others who were dissatisfied with life in the 
town to which they were condemned by force of circumstances and 
who longed for something that they considered higher and better 
and which had escaped them  becoming every day farther away and 
more inaccessible  though they used to meet together with their 
student comrades  these youths usually kept apart from their edu  
cated fellows either by some crude form of irony or by their un  
friendly silence  they could not take part as equals in their conver  
sations  therefore  constantly tormented by their feeling of in  
feriority  they now exaggerated and stressed in conversation their 
crudeness and ignorance by comparison with their more fortunate 
comrades or  from the height of their ignorance  mocked at all that 
they could not understand  in either case  envy breathed out of them 
as an almost visible and tangible force  but youth easily bears with 
even the worst instincts  and lives and moves freely and easily 
amongst them  

there had been and there would be again starlight nights on the 
kapia and rich constellations and moonlight  but there had never 
been  and god alone knows whether there would be again  such 
young men who in such conversations and with such feelings and 
ideas would keep vigil on the kapia  that was a generation of rebel 
angels  in that short moment while they still had all the power and 
all the rights of angels and also the flaming pride of rebels  these 
sons of peasants  traders or artisans from a remote bosnian town  
ship had obtained from fate  without any special effort of their own  
a free entry into the world and the great illusion of freedom  with 
their inborn small town characteristics  they went out into the 

    



world  chose more or less for themselves and accordmg to their own 
inclinations  momentary moods or the whims of chance  the subject 
of their studies  the nature of their entertainments and the circle of 
their friends and acquaintances  for the most part they were unable  
or did not know how  to seize and make use of what they succeeded 
in seeing  but there was not one of them who did not have the feel  
ing that he could take what he wished and that all that he took was 
his  life  that word came up very often m their conversations  as it 
did in the literature and politics of the time  when it was always 
written wth a capital letter   life stood before them as an object  
as a field of action for their liberated senses  for their intellectual 
curiosity and their sentimental exploits  which knew no limits  all 
roads were open to them  onward to infinity  on most of those roads 
they would never even set foot  but none the less the intoxicating 
lust for life lay in the fact that they could  m theory at least  be free 
to choose which they would and dare to cross from one to the other  
all that other men  other races  in other times and lands  had 
achieved and attained m the course of generations  through centuries 
of effort  at the cost of lives  of renunciations and of sacrifices greater 
and dearer than life  now lay before them as a chance inheritance 
and a dangerous gift of fate  it seemed fantastic and improbable but 
was none the less true  they could do with their youth what they 
liked  and give their judgments freely and without restriction  they 
dared to say what they liked and for many of them those words were 
the same as deeds  satisfying their atavistic need for heroism and 
glory  violence and destruction  yet they did not entail any obliga  
tion to act nor any visible responsibility for what had been said  the 
most gifted amongst them despised all that they should have learnt 
and underestimated all that they were able to do  but they boasted 
of what they did not know and waxed enthusiastic at what was be  
yond their powers to achieve  it is hard to imagine a more dan  
gerous manner of entering into life or a surer way towards excep  
tional deeds or total disaster  only the best and strongest amongst 
them threw themselves into action with the fanaticism of fakirs and 
were there burnt up like flies  to be immediately hailed by their fel  
lows as mart  s and saints  for there is no generation tothout its 
saints  and placed on pedestals as inaccessible examples  

every human generation has its own illusions with regard to civi  
lization  some believe that they are taking part in its upsurge  others 
that they are witnesses of its extinction in fact  it always both flames 
up and smoulders and is extmguished  according to the place and the 
angle of view  this generation which was now discussing philo  
sophy  social and political questions on the kapia under the stars  

    



above the waters  was richer only m illusions  in every other way 
it was similar to any other it had the feeling both of lighting the 
first fires of one new civilization and extinguishing the last flickers 
of another which was burning out  what could especially be said of 
them was that there had not been for a long time past a generation 
which with greater boldness had dreamed and spoken about life  en  
joyment and freedom and which had received less of life  suffered 
worse  laboured more hardly and died more often than had this one 
but in those summer days of      all was still undetermined  unsure  
everything appeared as an exciting new game on that ancient bridge  
which shone in the moonlight of those july nights  clean  young and 
unalterable  strong and lovely in its perfection  stronger than all that 
time might bring and men imagine or do

j ust as one warm summer night in august is like another  so the 
discussions of these schoolboys and students on the kapia were 
always the same or similar  

immediately after a good supper hurriedly eaten  for the day 
had passed in bathing and basking in the sun  they arrived one by 
one on the kapia  there was janko stikovid  son of a tailor from 
mejdan  who had already been studying natural science at graz for 
two years  he was a thin young man with sharp features and smooth 
black hair  vain  sensitive  dissatisfied with himself but even more 
with everyone about him  he read much and wrote articles under a 
pen name which was already well known in revolutionary youth 
papers published in prague and zagreb  he also wrote poems and 
published them under another pen name  he was preparing a book 
of them which was to be published by zora  the nationalist edition  
he was also a good speaker and a fiery debater at students  meetings  
velimir stevanovid was a healthy  well built youth  an adopted child 
of uncertain parentage  he was ironic  down to earth  thrifty and in  
dustrious  he had completed his medical studies at prague there was 
jacov herak  son of the good natiued and popular visegrad post  
man  a small  dark law student  of piercing eyes and swift words  a 
socialist of polemical spirit  who was ashamed of his kind heart and 
concealed every trace of emotion  ranko mihailovid was a taciturn 
and good natured youth was was studying law at zagreb and was al  
ready thinking of a career as a civil servant he took little part and 
that half heartedly in his comrades  arguments and discussions on 
love  politics  views on life and social conditions  on his mother s 
side he was the great grandson of that pop mihailo whose head  with 
a cigar stuck between its lips  had been put on a stake and exposed 
on that very kapia  

there were also a few sarajevo secondary school students who 
listened avidly to their older colleagues and their tales of life in the 
great cities  and with the imagination that whips up the vanity and 
hidden desires of children thought of everything as even greater and 


    



more beautiful than it really was or ever could be  among them was 
nikola glasicanin  a pale stiff youth who because of poverty  poor 
health and lack of success had had to leave the secondary school 
after the fourth class and return to the town and accept a post as 
clerk to a german timber exporting firm he came from a decayed 
landowning family at okoliste his grandfather  milan glasijanin  
had died a short time after the occupation  in the sarajevo lunatic 
asylum  after gambling away in his youth the greater part of his 
property his father  peter  a sickly creature without will  force or 
reputation had died some time ago now nikola spent all day long 
on the river bank with the workmen who poled the heavy pine logs 
and made them into rafts he measured the cubic meterage of the 
wood and afterwards  in the office  entered it in the books this 
monotonous task among such people  without ideals and without 
wider views  he felt as a torture and a humiliation  and the absence 
of any likelihood of being able to change his social status or get on 
in the world had created of the sensitive youth a man old before 
his time  bilious and taciturn  he read much in his spare time  but 
that spiritual food did nothing to give him force or exalt him  for 
everything in him took a sour turn his bad luck  his loneliness and 
his suffering opened his eyes and sharpened his senses to many 
things  but even the most beautiful thoughts and most precious 
knowledge could only discourage and embitter him the more  for 
they threw an even stronger light on his lack of success and his lack 
of prospects in the town  

there was also vlado marid  a locksmith by trade  a merry and 
good humoured man whom his colleagues from the higher schools 
loved and invited  as much for his strong and lovely baritone as for 
his simple heartedness and goodness this vigorous young man with 
his locksmith s cap on his head was one of those humble men who 
are always sufficient to themselves and do not think of comparing 
themselves with others  but calmly and thankfully accept whatever 
life offers to them and give simply and naturally all they can  

there were also the two local schoolmistresses  zorka and 
zagorka  both born in the town  all the youths competed for their 
favours and around them played that naive  complicated  brilliant 
and tormenting game of love  in their presence the discussions raged 
like a court of love in earlier centuries  because of them young men 
would later sit on the kapia smoking in the darkness and solitude or 
singing with others after an evening spent drinking somewhere else  
because of them there were hidden enmities between comrades  
badly concealed jealousies and open quarrels  about ten o clock the 
girls would go home  but the young men remained for long  though 

    



the mood on the kapia slackened and the nval eloquence diminished  

stikovid  who usually took the lead in these discussions  that even  
ing sat silent  smoking he was troubled and out of humour with 
himself  but he concealed it as he always concealed all his true feel  
ings  though he never succeeded in concealmg them completely  that 
afternoon he had had his first rendezvous with the schoolmistress 
zorka  an attractive girl with a full figure  pale face and fiery eyes 
on stikovid s insistence  they had been able to do the most difficult 
of all things in a small town  that is for a youth and a girl to meet in 
a hidden place where no one could see them or know anything about 
it they had met in her school which was deserted at that time be  
cause of the holidays  he had gone in from one street  through the 
garden  and she from another by the mam entrance they had met 
in a dimly lit  dusty room piled almost to the ceiling with benches  
it is thus that the passion of love is often compelled to look for re  
mote and ugly places they could neither sit nor he down  both of 
them were embarrassed and awkward too full of desire  too im  
patient  they embraced and mingled on one of those benches which 
she knew so well  without looking at or noticing anything around 
them he was the first to recover  abruptly  without transition  as 
young men do  he stood up to arrange his clothing and go away  the 
girl burst into tears  their disillusion was mutual when he had more 
or less calmed down he went out  almost as if escaping  by a side 
door  

at home he met the postman who had brought the youth paper 
with his article the balkans  serbia and bosnia herzegovina   read  
ing the article again turned his thoughts away from the incident of 
a few moments before  but even in that he found reason for dissatis  
faction there were printers  errors m the article and some of the 
sentences sounded silly to him  now  when it was no longer pos  
sible to make alterations  it seemed to him that many things could 
have been better expressed  more clearly and more concisely  

the same evening they sat on the kapia discussing his article in the 
presence of zorka herself  his prinapal adversary was the talkative 
and aggressive herak who looked at everything and criticized every  
thing from an orthodox socialist viewpoint  the others only inter  
vened m the discussion from time to time  the two schoolmistresses 
remained silent  preparing an unseen wreath for the victor  stikovid 
defended himself weakly  firstly because he himself now saw many 
weaknesses and illogicalities in his own article  though he would 
never admit this before his colleagues  and secondly because he was 
troubled by the memory of the afternoon in the dusty and stuffy 
classroom  a scene which now seemed to him both comic and ugly 


    



but which had long been the aim of his most intense desires and his 
most ardent feelmgs towards the pretty schoolmistress  she herself 
was sitting there in the summer darkness looking at him with shining 
eyes  he felt like a debtor and a criminal and would have given much 
not to have been in the school that day and not to be here with her 
now  in such a mood  herak seemed to him like an aggressive gadfly 
from whose attacks he could only defend himself with difficulty it 
seemed to him that he must answer not only for his article but also 
for all that had happened that day in the school  above all he wanted 
to be alone  somewhere far away  so that he could think calmly of 
something other than the article or the girl  but self love drove him 
on to defend himself  stikovid quoted cvijid and strosmajer  herak 
kautsky and babel  

 you are putting the cart before the horse   shouted herak  
analysing stikovid s article   it is not possible for the balkan peasant  
plunged in poverty and every sort of misery  to found a good and 
lasting state organization  only the preliminary economic liberation 
of the exploited classes  the peasants and the workers  that is to say 
the greater number of the people  can create real conditions for the 
formation of independent states  that is a natural process and the 
road we all must take  and in no way the other way round  there  
fore both national liberation and unification must be carried out in 
the spirit of socialist liberation and renascence  otherwise it will 
happen that the peasant  worker and ordinary citizen will introduce 
their pauperism and their slavish mentality  like a mortal contagion  
into the new state formations and the small number of exploiters will 
instil into them their parasitical  reactionary mentality and their 
anti social instincts  therefore enduring states or a healthy society 
cannot exist   

 all that is foreign book learning  my good fellow   answered 
stikovid   which vanishes before the living impetus of awakened 
nationalist forces among the serbs and then among the croats and 
slovenes also  though tending to one aim  things do not come to pass 
according to the forecasts of german theoreticians but advance in 
complete accord with the deep sense of our history and our racial 
destiny  from karageorge s words   let each kill his turkish chief 
the social problem in the balkans has always solved itself by the way 
of national liberation movements and wars  it all moves beautifully 
lo cally  from the less to the great  from the regional and tribal to 
the national and the formation of the state  were not our victories 
at kumanovo and on the bregalnica also the greatest victories of 
progressive thought and social justice   

 that remains to be seen   broke in herak  

    



 who does not see it now  will never see it  we believe     

 you believe  but we believe nothing  but want to be convinced by 
actual proofs and facts   answered herak  

 surely the disappearance of the turks and the weakening of 
austro hungary as the first step towards her annihilation are really 
the victories of small  democratic peoples and enslaved classes in 
their aspiration to find a place m the sun   stikovid developed his 
idea  

 if the realization of nationalist aims brings with it the creation of 
social justice  then in the western european states which have for 
the most part achieved all their nationalist ideals and are in that 
matter satisfied  there should no longer be any major social prob  
lems  or movements  or conflicts  yet we see that that is not so  on 
the contrary   

 and i keep telling you   stikovid answered weariedly   that with  
out the creation of independent states on the basis of national unity 
and modern conceptions of personal and social liberty  there can be 
no talk of  social liberation   for  as some frenchman once said  
politics come first         

 the stomach comes first   interrupted herak 

the others too became heated and the naive students  discussion 
became a youthful squabble with everyone talking at once and inter  
rupting one another and which  at the first quips  degenerated into 
laughter and shouting  

that was a welcome excuse for stikovid to break off the argument 
and remain silent  without having to give the impression of a with  
drawal or a defeat  

after zorka and zagorka who went home about ten o clock  es  
corted by velimir and ranko  the others too began to disperse  at last 
only stikovid and nikola glasidanin were left  

these two were about the same age  at one time they had gone to 
school together and had shared the same lodgings in sarajevo  they 
knew one another down to the last detail and just for that reason 
they could neither of them make up their mind whether they really 
liked one another  with the years the distance between them 
naturally became wider and harder to bridge  every vacation they 
met again here in the town and each took the other s measure and 
looked on the other as an inseparable enemy  now the beautiful and 
wayward schoolmistress zorka had also come between them  in the 
long months of the previous winter she had gone about with glasi  
danin who had never concealed  or been able to conceal  that he was 
in love  he had plunged head over heels in love with all the fire that 
embittered and dissatisfied persons can put into such an emotion  


    



but as soon as the summer months came and the students began to 
appear  the sensitive glasicanm was unable to avoid seeing the in  
terest that the schoolmistress showed in stikovid for that reason the 
old tension between them  which had always been kept hidden from 
others  had greatly increased  all this vacation they had not once 
been alone together as they were now  

now that chance had so arranged it  the first thought of each of 
them was to separate as soon as possible without conversation which 
could only be unpleasant for both  but some ridiculous considera  
tion  known only to youth  prevented them from doing as they 
wished  but in this embarrassment chance again helped them and 
lessened at least for a moment the heavy silence that oppressed them  

in the darkness could be heard the voices of two youths who were 
walkmg on the bndge  they were moving slowly and  ust then halted 
by the kapia behind the angle of the parapet  so that stikovid and 
glasidanin could not see them  or be seen by them  from their seat on 
the sofa  but they could hear every word and the voices were well 
known to them  they were two of their younger comrades  toma 
galus and fehim bahtijarevid  these two kept themselves a little 
apart from the group which comprised most of the other students 
and which gathered every evening on the kapia around stikovid and 
herak  for  although younger  galus was a rival of stikovid both as 
a poet and as a nationalist speaker  he did not like stikovid nor ad  
mire him  while bahtijarevid was exceptionally silent  proud and re  
served as befitted a true grandchild of a family of begs  

toma galus was a tall youth with red cheeks and blue eyes his 
father  alban von galus  the last descendant of an ancient family of 
the burgenland  had come to the town as a civil servant immediately 
after the occupation  he had been for twelve years a forestry inspec  
tor and now lived in the town on pension  at the very beginning  he 
had married the daughter of one of the local landowners  hadji toma 
stankovid  a robust and full blown young woman of dark skin and 
strong will  they had had three children  two daughters and one son  
all of whom had been christened into the serbian orthodox church 
and had grown up like real townsmen s children and grandchildren 
of hadji toma  

old galus  a tall and formerly a very handsome man  with a 
pleasant smile and masses of thick white hair  had long become a 
real townsman   mr albo   whom the younger generation could not 
think of as a foreigner and a newcomer  he had two passions which 
harmed no one  hunting and his pipe  and had made many old and 
true friends  both among the serbs and among the moslems  through  
out the whole district who shared his passion for the chase  he had 


    



completely assimilated many of their customs as if he had been born 
and bred amongst them  espeaally their habit of cheerful silence and 
calm conversation  so characteristic of men who are passionate 
smokers and who love hunting  the forests and life in the open  

young galus had matriculated that year at sarajevo and that 
autumn was due to go on to vienna to study but in the matter of 
these studies there was a division of opinion in the family  the father 
wanted his son to study technical sciences or forestry and the son 
wanted to study philosophy  for toma galus only resembled his 
father in appearance and all his desires led him in a completely oppo  
site direction  he was one of those good scholars  modest and ex  
emplary in everything  who pass all their examinations with ease as 
if playing at them  but whose real and sincere interests are taken up 
with satisfying their somewhat confused and disordered spiritual 
aspirations outside school and outside the official curriculum these 
are students of serene and simple heart but of uneasy and inquisitive 
spirit  those difficult and dangerous crises of the life of the senses 
and emotions through which so many other young men of their age 
pass  are almost unknown to them  therefore they find difficulty 
in stilling their spiritual anxieties and very often remain all their 
lives dilettantes  interesting eccentrics without stable occupation or 
definite interests  as every young man must not only fulfil the eternal 
and natural demands of youth and matunty and also pay tribute to 
the current spiritual moods and fashions of his time  which for the 
moment reign amongst youth  galus too had written verses and was 
an active member of the revolutionary nationahst student organiza  
tions  he had also studied french for five years as an optional sub  
ject  taken an interest in literature and  more especially  philosophy 
he read passionately and indefatigably  the main body of reading 
of the young men at school in sarajevo at that time consisted of 
works from the well known and enormous german publishing list 
reclams universal bibhotek  these small  cheap booklets with yel  
low covers and exceptionally small print were the main spiritual 
food available to the students of that time  from them they could be  
come acquainted not only with german literature  but with all the 
more important works in world literature in german translation  
from them galus drew his knowledge of modern german philoso  
phers  especially nietzsche and stimer  and in his walks in sarajevo 
along the banks of the miljajka held endless discussions about them 
with a sort of cold passion  in no way linking his reading with his 
personal life  as so many youths often do  this type of young scholar 
just through his examinations  ripened too early and overloaded 
with all kinds of varied  chaotic and unco ordinated knowledge  was 


    



not rare among the students of that time a modest youth and a good 
student  galus knew the freedom and the unrestraint of youth 
only in the daring of his thoughts and the exaggerations of his 
reading  

fehim bahtijarevid was a townsman on his mother s side only  
his father had been born in rogatica and was now kadi  moslem 
judge  there  but his mother was from the great local family of 
osmanagid  from his earliest childhood he had passed a part of the 
summer vacation in the town with his mother and her relatives  he 
was a slender youth  graceful and well formed  fine boned but strong  
everything about him was measured  restrained  controlled  the fine 
oval of his face was sunburnt  his skin browned with light touches 
of a dark bluish shade  his movements few and abrupt  his eyes were 
black with blue shadings in the whites and his glance burning but 
without sparkle  he had thick eyebrows which met  and a fine black 
down on his upper lip  such faces are reminiscent of persian 
miniatures  

that summer he too had matriculated and he was now waiting to 
get a state grant to study oriental languages in vienna  

the two young men were continuing some conversation begun 
earlier  the subject was bahtijarevid s choice of studies  galus was 
proving to him that he would be making a mistake in taking up 
oriental studies in general galus spoke much more  and more ani  
matedly  than his companion for he was accustomed to be listened 
to and to lay down the law  while bahtijarevid spoke shortly  like a 
man who has his own fixed ideas and feels no need to convince any  
one else  like most young men who have read much  galus spoke 
with a naive satisfaction in words  picturesque expressions and com  
parisons  and with a tendency to generalize  whereas bahtijarevid 
spoke dryly  curtly  almost indifferently  

hidden in the shadows and reclining on the stone seats  stikovid 
and glasidanin remained silent as if they had tacitly agreed to listen 
to the conversation of their two comrades on the bridge  

finishing the conversation about studies  galus said belligerently  

 in that you moslems  you begs  sons  often make a mistake  dis  
concerted by the new times  you no longer know your exact and 
rightful place in the world  your love for everything oriental is only 
a contemporary expression of your  will to power   for you the 
eastern way of life and thought is very closely bound up with a social 
and legal order which was the basis of your centuries of lordship  
that is understandable  but it in no way means that you have any 
sense for orientalism as a study  you are orientals but you are making 
a mistake when you think that you are thereby called upon to be 

    



orientalists  in general you have not got the calling or the true in  
clination for science   

 really   

 no  you haven t  and when i say that  i am not saying anything in  
sulting or offensive  on the contrary  you are the only nobles in this 
country  or a least you were  for centuries you have enlarged  con  
firmed and defended your privileges by sword and pen  legally  reli  
giously and by force of arms  that has made of you typical warriors  
admmistrators and landowners  and that class of men nowhere in the 
world worries about abstract sciences but leaves them to those who 
have nothing else and can do nothing else  the true studies for you 
are law and economics  for you are men of practical knowledge  such 
are men from the ruling classes  always and everywhere   

 you mean that we should remain uneducated   

 no  it does not mean that  but it means that you must remain 
what you are or  if you like  what you have been  you must  for no 
one can be at the same time what he is and the contrary of what he 
is   

 but we are no longer a ruling class today  today we are all equal   
bahtijarevid broke in once more with a touch of irony  in which was 
both bitterness and pride  

 you are not  naturally you are not  the conditions which at one 
time made you what you were have changed long ago  but that does 
not mean that you can change with the same speed  this is not the 
first  nor will it be the last  instance of a social caste losing its reason 
for existence and yet remaining the same  conditions of life change 
but a class remains what it is  for only so can it exist and as such it 
will die   

the conversation of the two unseen youths broke off for a 
moment  stifled by bahtijarevid s silence  

in the clear june sky  above the dark mountains on the honzon  
the moon appeared  the white plaque with the turkish inscription 
suddenly shone in the moonlight  like a dimly lit window in the blue  
black darkness  

bahtijarevid then said something  but in so low a voice that only 
disjointed and incomprehensible words reached stikovid and glasi  
danin  as so often in young men s discussions  in which changes of 
subject are rapid and bold  the conversation was now about another 
matter  from the study of oriental languages  they had now passed on 
to the content of the inscription on the white plaque before them 
and to the bridge and he who had built it  

galus s voice was the louder and more expressive  while agreeing 
with bahtijarevid s praises of mehmed pasha sokolovid and the tur  

    



kish administration of his times  which had made possible the build  
ing of such a bridge  he now developed his nationalist views on the 
past and present of the people  their culture and civilization  for in 
such student discussions each follows his own train of thought   

 you are right   said galus   he must have been a man of genius 
he was not the first nor the last man of our blood who distinguished 
himself in the service of a foreign empire  we have given hundreds 
of such men  statesmen  generals and artists  to stambul  rome and 
vienna  the sense of our national unification in a single  great and 
powerful modern state lies just in that our own forces should re  
main in our own country and develop there and make their contri  
bution to general culture in our name and not from foreign centres   
 do you really think that those  centres  arose by chance and that 
it is possible to create new ones at will whenever and wherever one 
likesr 

 chance or not  that is no longer the question  it is not important 
how they arose  but it is important that today they are disappeanng  
that they have flowered and decayed  that they must make way for 
new and different centres  through which young and free nations  
appearing for the first time on the stage of history  can express them  
selves directly   

 do you think that mehmed pasha sokolovid  had he remained a 
peasant s child up there yonder at sokolovidi  would have become 
what he became and would  among other things  have built this 
bridge on which we are now talking   

 in those times  certainly  he would not  but  when you come to 
think of it  it was not hard for stambul to put up such buildings  
when it took from us  and from so many other subject peoples  not 
only property and money  but also our best men and our purest 
blood  if you stop to think what we are and how much has been 
stolen from us through the centuries  then all these buildings are 
merely crumbs  but when we finally achieve our national freedom 
and our independence  then our money and our blood will be ours 
alone  and will stay ours everything will be solely and uniquely for 
the improvement of our own national culture  which will bear our 
mark and our name and which will be mindful of the happiness and 
prosperity of all our people   

bahtijarevid remained silent  and that silence  like the most lively 
and eloquent speech   provoked galus  he raised his voice and con  
tinued in a sharper tone  with all his natural vivacity and all the 
vocabulary then prevalent in nationalist literature  he set out the 
plans and aims of the revolutionary youth movement  all the living 
forces of the race must be awakened and set in action  under their 


    



blows the austro hungarian monarchy  that prison of the peoples  
would disintegrate as the turkish empire had disintegrated  all the 
anti national and reactionary forces which today hinder  divide and 
lull to sleep our national forces will be routed and trampled under  
foot  all this can be done  for the spirit of the times in which we live 
is our strongest ally  for all the efforts of all the other small and 
oppressed nations support us modem nationalism will triumph over 
religious diversities and outmoded prejudice  will liberate our people 
from foreign influence and exploitation  then will the national state 
be born  

galus then described all the advantages and beauties of the new 
national state which was to rally all the southern slavs around 
serbia as a sort of piedmont on the basis of complete national unity  
religious tolerance and civil equality his speech mixed up bold 
v ords of uncertain meaning and expressions that accurately ex  
pressed the needs of modern life  the deepest desires of a race  most 
of which were destined to remain only desires  and the justified and 
attainable demands of everyday reality it mingled the great truths 
which had ripened through the generations but which only youth 
could perceive in advance and dare to express  with the eternal illu  
sions which are never extinguished but never attain realization  for 
one generation of youth hands them on to the next like that mytho  
logical torch in the young man s speech there were  naturally  many 
assertions which could not have stood up to the criticism of reality 
and many suppositions which could not  perhaps  have borne 
the proof of experience  but in it too was that freshness  that 
precious essence which maintains and rejuvenates the tree of 
humanity  

bahtijarevid remained silent 

tou will see  fehim   galus enthusiastically assured his friend as 
if it were a matter of the same night or the next morning  you will 
see we shall create a state which will make the most precious con  
tribution to the progress of humanity  in which every effort will be 
blessed  every sacrifice holy  every thought original and expressed in 
our own words  and every deed marked with the stamp of our name  
then we will carry out work which will be the result of our free 
labour and the expression of our racial genius  put up buildings in 
comparison with which all that has been done in the centuries of 
foreign administration will appear like silly toys we will bridge 
greater rivers and deeper abysses we will build new  greater and 
better bridges  not to link foreign centres with conquered lands but 
to link our own lands with the rest of the world there cannot be any 
doubt any longer we are destined to realize all that the generations 



before us have aspired to  a state  bom in freedom and founded on 
justice  like a part of god s thought realized here on earth   

bahtijarevid remained silent  even galus s voice lowered in 
as his ideas became more exalted  his voice became lower and lower  
hoarser and hoarser  till it became a strong and passionate whisper 
and was finally lost in the great silence of the night  at last both 
young men were silent  but none the less bahtijarevid s silence 
seemed a thing apart  heavy and obstinate in the night  it seemed like 
an impassable wall in the darkness which by the very weight of its 
existence resolutely rejected all that the other had said  and ex  
pressed its dumb  clear and unalterable opinion  

the foundations of the world and the bases of life and human rela  
tionships in it have been fixed for centuries  that does not mean that 
they do not change  but measured by the length of human existence 
they appear eternal  the relation between their endurance and the 
length of human existence is the same as the relation between the 
uneasy  moving and swift surface of a river and its stable and solid 
bed whose changes are slow and imperceptible  the very idea of the 
change of these  centres  is unhealthy and unacceptable  that would 
be as if someone wished to change and measure the sources of great 
rivers or the sites of mountains  the desire for sudden changes and 
the thought of their realization by force often appears among men 
like a disease and gains ground mainly in young brains  only these 
brains do not think as they should  do not amount to anything in the 
end and the heads that think thus do not remain long on their 
shoulders  for it is not human desires that dispose and administer the 
things of the world desire is like a wind  it shifts the dust from one 
place to another  sometimes darkens the whole horizon  but in the 
end calms down and falls and leaves the old and eternal picture of 
the world  lasting deeds are realized on this earth only by god s will  
and man is only his blind and humble tool a deed which is bom of 
desire  human desire  either does not live till realization or is not 
lasting  in no case is that good  all these tumultuous desires and 
daring words under the night sky on the kapia will not change any  
thing basically  they will pass  beneath the great and permanent reali  
ties of the world and will be lost where all desires and winds are 
stilled  in truth great men and great buildings rise and will rise only 
where they are appointed to arise in god s thought  in their right 
place independent of empty transient desires and human vanity   

but bahtijarevid did not utter a single one of these words  those 
who  like this moslem youth of noble family  carry their philosophy 
in their blood  live and die according to it  do not know how to ex  
press it in words  or feel the need to do so  after this long silence 

    



stikovid and glasi anin only saw one or other of the pair of unseen 
comrades throw a cigarette stub over the parapet and watched it fall 
like a shooting star in a great curve from the bridge into the drina  
at the same time they heard the two friends slowly and softly 
moving away towards the market place  the sound of their foot  
steps was soon lost  

alone once more  stikovid and glasifanin started and looked at 
one another as though they had only just met  

in the pale moonlight their faces showed in bright and dark sur  
faces sharply defined  so that they seemed much older than in fact 
they were the glow from their cigarettes had a sort of phosphores  
cence both were depressed  their reasons were quite different  but 
the depression was mutual  both had the same wish  to get up and go 
home  but both seemed as if nailed to the stone seats still warm from 
the day s sunlight  the conversation of that pair of young comrades 
which they by chance overheard had been welcome to them as a 
postponement of their own conversation and mutual explanation  
but now it could no longer be avoided 

 did you hear herak and his arguments   stikovid spoke first  re  
ferring to the evening s discussion  and at once felt the weakness of 
his position  

glasidanin  who for his part felt the momentary advantage of his 
position as arbiter  did not reply at once  

 i ask you   went on stikovid impatiently   in these days to speak 
of class struggle and recommend small measures  when it is clear to 
every last man amongst us that national unity and liberation carried 
out by revolutionary methods is the most pressing aim of our com  
munity  why  that is downright silly   

his voice held both a question and an appeal  but again glasidanin 
did not reply  in the hush of that revengeful and vindictive silence  
the sound of music came to them from the officers  mess on the river 
bank  the ground floor windows were wide open and brightly lit  a 
violin was playing with a piano accompanying it  it was the military 
doctor  regimentsarzt balas  who was playing  accompanied by the 
wife of the commander of the garrison  colonel bauer  they were 
practising the second movement of schubert s sonatina for violin 
and piano they played well together but before they were halfway 
through the piano was ahead and the violinist stopped playing  after 
a short silence  during which they were doubtless arguing about the 
disputed passage  they began again  they practised together almost 
every evening and played until late at night  while the colonel sat in 
another room playing endless games of preference or simply dozing 
over mostar wine and tobacco while the younger officers joked 


    



among themselves at the expense of the enamoured musicians  

between madame bauer and the young doctor a complicated and 
difficult story had m fact been building up for months not even the 
keenest eyed among the officers had been able to decide on the real 
nature of the relationship some said that the tie between them was 
wholly spiritual  and naturally laughed at it   while others said that 
the body had its due share in the matter also the two were  however  
inseparable  with the full fatherly approval of the colonel who was 
a good natured man  already blunted by long service  the weight of 
years  wine and tobacco 

the whole town looked on these two as a couple  otherwise  the 
whole officers  mess lived a completely isolated life  without any 
connection with the local people and citizens or even the foreign 
officials at the entrance to their parks  filled with beds of rare 
flowers laid out in circles and stars  a notice announced impartially 
that it was forbidden to bring dogs into the parks and that civilians 
were not allowed to enter  their pleasures and their duties were alike 
inaccessible to all who were not in uniform their whole life was in 
fact that of a huge and completely exclusive caste  which cherished 
its exclusiveness as the most important aspect of its power and which 
beneath a brilliant and stiff exterior concealed all that life gave to 
other men of greatness and poverty  sweetness and bitterness 

but there are things which by their very nature cannot remain 
hidden  which break down every barrier however strong and cross 
even the most strictly guarded frontier  there are three things which 
cannot be hidden   say the osmanlis   and these are  love  a cough and 
poverty   this was the case with this pair of lovers  there was not 
an old man or a child  man or woman  in the town who had not come 
across them on one of their walks on unfrequented paths around the 
town  lost in conversation and completely blind and deaf to every  
thing about them  the shepherds were as used to them as to those 
pairs of beetles than can be seen in may on the leaves by the wayside  
always two by two in loving embrace  they were to be seen every  
where  along the drina and the rzav  by the ruins of the old fortress  
on the road leading from the town  or around stra iste  and that at 
any time of the day for time is always short to lovers and no path 
long enough  they sometimes rode or drove in a light carriage  but 
for the most part walked  and walked at that pace usual to two per  
sons who exist only one for the other  and with that characteristic 
gait which shows that they are indifferent to everything in the world 
save what each has to say to the other  

he was a hungarianized slovak  son of a civil servant and educated 
at state expense  young and genuinely musical he was ambitious 

    



but over sensitive about his origins which prevented him from feel  
ing at ease with the austrian or hungarian officers from rich and 
famous families she was a woman in her forties  eight years older 
than he  she was tall and blonde  already a little faded but her skin 
was still a clear pink and white  with her large shining dark blue 
eyes  in appearance and beanng she looked like one of those portraits 
of queens which so enchant young girls  

each of them had personal  real or imagined but deep  reasons for 
dissatisfaction with life  furthermore they had one great reason in 
common  both felt themselves to be unhappy and like outcasts m 
this town and this society of officers  for the most part frivolous and 
empty headed  so they clung to one another feverishly like two sur  
vivors of a shipwreck they lost themselves in one another and for  
got themselves in long conversations or  as now  in music  

such was the invisible pair whose music filled the troubled silence 
between the two youths  

a few moments later the music which had been pouring into the 
peaceful night again ran into difficulties and stopped for a time in 
the silence that followed  glasijanin began to speak in a wooden sort 
of voice  picking up stikovid s last words  

 silly  there was much that was silly in that whole discussion  if 
we look at it fairly   

stikovid suddenly took the cigarette from his lips  but glasif anin 
went on slowly but resolutely to express views which were clearly 
not based on that night only but which had long troubled him 

 i listen carefully to all these discussions  both those between you 
two and other educated people in this town  also i read the news  
papers and reviews but the more i listen to you  the more i am con  
vinced that the greater part of these spoken or written discussions 
have no connection with life at all and its real demands and prob  
lems  for life  real life  i look at from very close indeed  i see its in  
fluence on others and i feel it on myself  it may be that i am mistaken 
and that i do not know how to express myself well  but i often think 
that technical progress and the relative peace there is now m the 
world have created a sort of lull  a special atmosphere  artificial and 
unreal  in which a single class of men  the so called intellectuals  can 
freely devote themselves to idleness and to the interesting game of 
ideas and  views on life and the world   it is a sort of conservatory of 
the spirit  with an artificial climate and exotic flowers but without 
any real connection with the earth  the real hard soil on which the 
mass of human beings move  you think that you are discussing the 
fate of these masses and their use in the struggle for the realization 
of higher aims which you have fixed for them  but in fact the wheels 

    



which you turn in your heads have no connection with the life of the 
masses  nor with life m general  that game of yours becomes dan  
gerous  or least might become dangerous  both for others and for you 
yourselves   

glasicanin paused stikovid was so astonished by this long and con  
sidered exposition that he had not even thought of interrupting him 
or answering him only when he heard the word  dangerous  he made 
an ironical gesture with his hand  that irritated glasijanin who con  
tinued even more animatedly  

 for heaven s sake  listening to you  one would think that all ques  
tions were settled happily  all dangers for ever removed  all roads 
made smooth and open so all we have to do is to walk along them  
but in life there is nothing solved  or which can easily be solved  or 
even has any chance of being solved at all  everything is hard and 
complicated  expensive and accompanied by disproportionately high 
risk  there is no trace either of herak s bold hopes or of your wide 
horizons  man is tormented all his life and never has what he needs  
let alone what he wants  theories such as yours only satisfy the eter  
nal need for games  flatter your own vanity  deceive yourself 
and others  that is the truth  or at least that is how it appears to 
me   

 it is not so  you have only to compare various historical periods 
and you will see the progress and meaning of man s struggle and 
therefore also the  theory  that gives sense and direction to that 
struggle   

glasi anin at once took this to be an allusion to his interrupted 
schooling and as always in such a case quivered inwardly  

 i have not studied history         he began  

 you see  if you had studied it  you would see         

 but neither have you   

 what  that is       well  yes of course i have studied   

 as well as natural sciences   

his voice quivered vindictively  stikovid was embarrassed for a 
moment and then said in a dead sort of voice  

 oh well  if you really want to know  there it is  besides natural 
sciences  i have been taking an interest in political  historical and 
social problems   

tou are lucky to have had the chance  for as far as i know  you 
are an orator and an agitator also  as well as being a poet and a lover   

stikovid smiled unnaturally  that afternoon in the deserted 
schoolroom passed through his mind as a distant but irritating thing  
only then he realized that glasidanin and zorka had been close 
friends until his arrival in the town  a man who does not love is in  


    



capable of feeling the greatness of another s love or the force of 
jealousy or the danger concealed in it  

the conversation of the two young men changed without transi  
tion into that bitter personal quarrel that had from the very begin  
ning been hovering in the air between them  young people do not 
try to avoid quarrels  even as young animals easily take part in 
rough and violent games among themselves  

 what   am and what i do is none of your business  i don t ask 
you about your cubes and your tree trunks   

that spasm of anger which always gripped glasicanin at any men  
tion of his position made him suffer  

 you leave my cubes alone  i live from them  but i don t trick 
people with them  i deceive no one  i seduce no one   

 whom do i seduce   broke in stikovid  

 anyone who will let you   

 that is not true   

 it is true  and you know it is true  since you force me to speak  
then i will tell you   

 i am not inquisitive   

 but i will tell you  for even leaping about tree trunks all day long 
a man may still see something and learn how to think and feel  i 
want to tell you what i think about your countless occupations 
and interests and yom daring theories and your verses and your 
loves   

stikovid made a movement as if to rise but none the less remained 
where he was  the piano and violin from the officers  mess had re  
sumed their duet some time ago  the third movement of the sonatina  
gay and lively  and their music was lost in the night and the roar 
of the river  

 thank you  i have heard all that from others more intelligent than 
you are   

 oh no  others either do not know you or lie to you or think as i 
do but keep silent  all your theories  all your many spiritual occupa  
tions  like your loves and your frien hips  all these derive from your 
ambition  and that ambition is false and unhealthy for it derives 
from your vanity  only and exclusively from your vanity   

 ha  hal  

 yes  even that nationalist idea which you preach so ardently is 
only a special form of vanity  for you are incapable of loving your 
mother or your sister or your own blood brother  so how much less 
an idea  only from vanity could you be good  generous  self  
sacrificing  for your vanity is the main force that moves you  the 
only thing you revere  the one and only thing that you love more 


    



than yourself one who doesn t know you might easily be mistaken  
seeing your force and your industry  your devotion to the nationalist 
ideal  to science  to poetry or to any other great aim which is above 
personal feelings but you cannot in any case serve it for long or re  
main with it for long  for your vanity will not let you  the moment 
your vanity is no longer in question  everything becomes meaning  
less to you yo do not want anything and would not even move a 
finger to obtain it because of it you will betray yourself  for you are 
yourself the slave of your own vanity you do not know yourself 
how vain you are i know your very soul and i know that you are a 
monster of vanity  

stikovid did not reply  at first he had been surprised at the con  
sidered and passionate outburst of his comrade who now suddenly 
appeared to him in a new light and an unexpected role  therefore 
that caustic  even speech which at first irritated and insulted him  
now seemed interesting and almost pleasant individual phrases had  
it is true  hit home and hurt  but on the whole all that sharp and pro  
found exposure of his character had flattered and pleased him in a 
special sort of way for to tell a young man that he is a monster 
merely means to tickle his pride and his self love in fact he wanted 
glasiianin to continue this cruel probing into his inner self  that clear 
projection of his hidden personality  for in it he found only one more 
proof of his exceptional superiority  his eyes fell on the white 
plaque opposite him which shone in the moonlight he looked 
straight at the incomprehensible turkish inscription as if he were 
reading it and trying to decipher the deeper sense of what his friend 
beside him had been saying penetratingly and consideredly 

 nothing is really important to you and  in fact  you neither love 
nor hate  for to do either you must at least for a moment stand out  
side yourself  express yourself  forget yourself  go beyond yourself 
and your vanity  but that you cannot do  nor is there anything for 
which you would do so even were you able  someone else s sorrow 
cannot move you  how much less hurt you  not even your own sor  
row unless it flatters your vanity  you desire nothing and you find joy 
in nothing  you are not even envious  not from goodness but from 
boundless egoism  for you do not notice the happiness or unhappiness 
of others  nothing can move you or turn you from your purpose 
you do not stop at anything  not because you are brave  but because 
all the healthy impulses in you are shrivelled up  because save for 
your vanity nothing exists for you  neither blood ties nor inward 
considerations  neither god nor the world  neither kin nor friend  
you do not esteem even your own natural capacities  instead of con  
science it is only your own wounded vanity that can sting you  for 

    



it alone  always and in everything  speaks with your mouth and dic  
tates your actions  

 is this an allusion to zorka   stikovid suddenly asked 

 yes  if you like  let us talk of that too  yes  because of zorka also  
you do not care a jot for her  it is only your inability to stop and 
restrain yourself before anything which momentarily and by chance 
is offered you and which flatters your vanity yes  that is so  you 
seduce a poor  muddled and inexperienced schoolmistress just as you 
write articles and poems  deliver speeches and lectures and even 
before you have completely conquered them you are already tired 
of them  for your vanity becomes bored and looks for something be  
yond  but that is your own curse too  that you can stop nowhere  
that you can never be sated and satisfied  you submit everything to 
your vanity but you are yourself the first of its slaves and its 
greatest martyr it may well be that you will have still greater glory 
and success  a greater success than the weakness of some love crazed 
girl  but you will find no satisfaction in any one thing  for your vanity 
will whip you onwards  for it swallows everything  even the greatest 
successes and then forgets them immediately  but the slightest 
failure or insult it will remember forever  and when everything is 
withered  broken  soiled  humiliated  disintegrated and destroyed 
about you  then you will remain alone m the wilderness you have 
yourself created  face to face with your vanity and you will have 
nothing to offer it  then you will devour yourself  but that will not 
help you  for your vanity accustomed to richer food will despise and 
reject you  that is what you are  though you may seem different m 
the eyes of most men and though you think differently of yourself 
but i know   

glasicanin ceased suddenly  

the freshness of the night could already be felt on the kapia and 
the silence spread  accompanied by the eternal roar of the waters  
they had not even noticed when the music from the bank had ceased  
both youths had completely forgotten where they were and what 
they were doing  each had been earned away by his own thoughts 
as only youth can be  the jealous and unhappy  cube measurer  had 
spoken only of what he had so many times thought over passion  
ately  deeply and intensely  but for which he had never before been 
able to find suitable words and expressions and which that night had 
come easily and eloquently  bitterly and exaltedly stikovid had 
listened  motionlessly looking at the white plaque with the inscrip  
tion as if it had been a cinema screen  every word had hit home  he 
felt every harsh comment but he no longer found in all that this 
scarcely visible friend beside him had said any insult or any danger  

    



on the other hand  it seemed to him that with every word of glasi  
 anin he grew  and that he flew on invisible wings  swift and un  
heard  exulting and daring  high above all men on this earth and their 
ties  laws and feelings  alone  proud and great  and happy or with 
some feeling akin to happiness  he flew above everything  that 
voice  those words of his nval  were only the sound of the waters 
and the roar of an invisible  lesser world far below him  it mattered 
little to him what it was  what it thought and what it said  for he 
flew above it as a bird  

the momentary silence of glasicanin seemed to bring them both 
to their senses  they did not dare to look at one another  god alone 
knows in what form the quarrel would have continued had there 
not appeared on the bndge a crowd of drunkards coming from the 
market place  shouting loudly and singing snatches of songs  loudest 
among them was a tenor who sang in falsetto an ancient song  

thou art wise as thou art lovely  

lovely fata avdagma      

they recognized the voices of a number of young merchants  and 
landowners  sons  some were walking slowly and sedately  others 
wavered and tottered  from their noisy jests it could be concluded 
that they had come from  under the poplars   

more than fifteen years earlier  even before the building of the 
railway had begun  a certain hungarian and his wife had settled in 
the town  he was called terdik and his wife julka  she spoke serbian 
for she had been born in novi sad  it soon became known that they 
had come with the intention of opening a business in the town for 
which the local people had no name they opened it on the outskirts 
of the town  under the tall poplars which grew on the straiiste slopes  
in an old turkish house which they completely rebuilt  

this was the town s house of shame  all day long the windows re  
mained shuttered  as dusk fell a white acetylene lamp was lit in the 
doorway which burned there all night  songs and the tinkle of an 
automatic piano echoed from the ground floor  young men and dis  
solute idlers bandied about among themselves the names of the girls 
whom terdik had brought and kept there  at first there were four of 
them  irma  ilona  frieda and aranka  

every friday  julka s girls  could be seen going in two cabs up to 
the hospital for their weekly inspection  they were heavily rouged 
and powdered  with flowers in their hats and with long handled sun  
shades with streamers of floating lace  when these cabs went by  the 
women of the town hustled their daughters out of sight and averted 

    



their eyes with mixed feelings of shame  disgust and pity 

when work began on the railway and there was an influx of 
money and workers  the number of girls was increased  besides the 
old turkish house  terdik built a new  planned  one with a red tiled 
roof which could be seen from afar   there were three rooms  the 
general room  the extra zimmer and the officers  salon  in each of 
them were different prices and different guests  at  under the pop  
lars   as it was known m the town  the sons and grandsons of those 
who had once drunk at zanje s inn  or later at lotte s  could leave 
their inherited or hard won money  the grossest practical jokes  the 
most notorious quarrels  wild dnnking parties and sentimental 
dramas took place there  many personal and family misfortunes had 
their origins in that house  

the centre of that group of drunkards who had spent the first part 
of the night  under the poplars  and had now come to cool off on the 
kapia was a certain nikola pecikoza  a silly good natured youth 
whom they made drunk and on whom they played their jokes  

before the drunkards reached the kapia they halted by the parapet  
a loud and drunken argument could be heard  nikola pecikoza bet 
two litres of wine that he would walk along the stone parapet to the 
end of the bridge  the bet was taken and the young man climbed on 
to the parapet and set out with arms outspread  placing one foot 
carefully before the other like a sleepwalker  when he reached the 
kapia he noticed the two late visitors  he said nothing to them but 
humming some song and wavering in his drunkenness continued on 
his dangerous way  while the merry party accompanied him  his 
great shadow in the weak moonlight danced on the bridge and broke 
into fragments on the opposite parapet  

the drunkards passed by in a frenzy of disconnected shouts and 
stupid comments  the two young men rose and  without saying 
goodnight  each went his own way to his own house  

glasi anin disappeared into the darkness towards the left bank 
where was the path which led to his house up at okolijte  stikovid 
made his way with slow steps in the opposite direction towards the 
market place  he walked slowly and irresolutely  he did not want to 
leave that place which was lighter and fresher than in the town he 
halted by the parapet  he felt the need to catch hold of something  
to lean on something  

the moon had set behind the vidova gora  leaning on the stone 
parapet at the end of the bridge the young man looked long at the 
huge shadows and few lights of his native town as if he now saw 
it for the first time  only two windows were still lighted in the 
officers  mess  the music could no longer be heard  probably the un  


 ss 



h ppy lovers were there  the doctor and the colonel s lady  holding 
their discussions on music and on love or about their personal fates 
which would not permit them to be at peace with themselves or with 
one another 

from the spot where stikovid was now standing he could see that 
one window was still lighted in lotte s hotel  the young man looked 
at those lighted windows on each side of the bndge as if he expected 
something from them he was tired out and melancholy  the verti  
ginous walk of that idiot pecikoza suddenly reminded him of his 
earliest childhood  when on his way to school he had seen in the mict 
of a winter s morning the squat figure of corkan danang on that 
same parapet every memory of his childhood aroused sorrow and 
uneasiness in him  that sentiment of fateful and exalted greatness 
and universal flight above everyone and everything which glasi  
janin s bitter and fiery words had excited in him was now lost  it 
seemed to him that he had suddenly fallen from the heights and that 
he was crawling on the darkened earth with everyone else  the 
memory of what had happened with the schoolmistress  and should 
not have happened  tormented him as if someone else had done it in 
his name  so too did the article which now seemed to him weak 
and full of faults  as if another had written it and had published 
it in his name and against his will  he thought of the long conversa  
tion with glasi anin which now all of a sudden seemed to him 
full of malice and hate  of bitter insults and real perils  

he shivered inwardly and from the chill which arose from the 
river as if suddenly awakened he noticed that the two windows in 
the officers  mess were no longer lighted  the last guests were leaving 
the building  he could hear the clink of their swords as they crossed 
the darkened square and the sound of loud  artificial chatter  the 
young man regretfully left the parapet and  looking at the solitary 
window still alight in the hotel  the last light in the sleeping town  
made his way slowly towards his simple house up there at mejdan

t he only lighted window in the hotel  which remained as the 
last sign of life that night in the town  was that small 
window on the first floor where lotte s room was even at 
night lotte sat there at her overladen table it was just as 
it had been earlier  more than twenty years before  when she had 
come to this little room to snatch a moment of respite from the 
bustle and noise of the hotel  only now everything downstairs 
was dark and quiet  

at ten o clock that night lotte had withdrawn to her room to 
sleep  but before she lay down she went over to the window to 
breathe in the freshness from the nver and to take a last glance 
at that arch of the bridge which was the only and eternally the 
same view from her window then she remembered some old 
account and sat down to look for it  once she began looking through 
her accounts she became absorbed and remained for more than 
two hours at her table  

midnight had long passed while lotte  wakeful and absorbed  
entered figure after figure and turned paper after paper  

lotte was tired  in the da  ime  in conversation and at work  she 
was still animated and talkative  but at night when she was alone 
she felt all the weight of her years and her fatigue  she had grown 
old  of her onetime beauty only traces remained  she had grown 
thinner and yellow in the face  her hair was without lustre and 
was growing thin on her scalp  and her teeth  once shining and 
strong  were yellow and showed gaps  the glance of her black 
and still shining eyes was hard and at times sad  

lotte was tired  but not with that blessed and sweet tiredness 
which follows heavy work and great gains  such as at one time 
had driven her to search for rest and respite in that room  old age 
had come upon her and the times were no longer good  

she would not have been able to express in words  nor could 
she explain it to herself  but she felt at every step that the times 
were out of joint  at any rate for one who had always kept only 

    



her own good and that of her family before her eyes  when  
thirty years before  she had come to bosnia and begim work there  
life had seemed all of a piece  everyone was moving in the samf 
direction as she was  work and family  everyone was in his right 
place and there was a place for everyone  and over everyone 
reigned one order and one law  an established order and a strict 
law  so had the world then appeared to lotte  now every thing 
had changed and was topsy turvy men were divided and separated 
without  it seemed to her  rhyme or reason the law of profit and 
loss  that divine law which had always controlled human activities  
seemed as if it were no longer valid  for so many men worked  
spoke or wrote about things of which she could not see the aim 
or the sense and which could only end in misfortune and damage  
life was bursting asunder  was crumbling  was disintegratmg  it 
seemed to her that the present generation attached more importance 
to its views on life than to life itself  it seemed to her mad and 
completely incomprehensible  yet it was so  therefore life was 
losing its value and wastmg away in mere words  lotte saw this 
clearly and felt it at every step  

her business affairs  which at one time had seemed to gambol 
before her eyes like a flock of spring lambs  now lay inert and 
dead like the great tombstones m the jewish cemetery  for the 
past ten years the hotel had done little business the forests around 
the town had been cut down and felling was moving farther and 
farther away  and with it the best of the hotel s customers and 
the greater part of its profits  that shameless and insolent boor  
terdik  had opened his house  under the poplars  and enticed away 
many of lotte s guests  offering them easily and immediately all 
that they had never been able to get in her hotel however much 
they paid  lotte had long revolted against this unfair and shameless 
competition and said that the last days had come  those days in 
which law and order existed no longer or the chance of making an 
honest hving  at first she had bitterly referred to terdik as  the 
whoremaster   but he had brought her before the courts and lotte 
had been sentenced to pay a fine for defamation of character  but 
even now she never referred to him by any other term  though 
she took care before whom she was speaking  the new officers  mess 
had its own restaurant  a cellar of good wines and its own guest  
rooms where distinguished visitors could be put up  gustav  the 
sullen and bad tempered but skilful and reliable gustav  had left 
the hotel after many years of service and opened his own caf  
in the most frequented part of the market place  and so instead 
of a colleague he had become a competitor  the choral society 

    



and the various reading rooms which had been opened in the 
town in the past few years had their own caf s and attracted many 
guests  

there was no longer the former animation either in the main 
room or  still less  in the extra zimmer  an occasional unmarried 
civil servant had his lunch there  read the newspapers and took 
coffee  alibeg pasid  the taciturn and impassioned fnend of lotte s 
youth  still went there every afternoon still as careful and discreet 
as ever  both in speech and actions  still correct and carefully 
dressed  he had grown grey and ponderous  his coffee was served 
with saccharine because of the severe diabetes from which he 
had been suffering for years he smoked quietly and  silent as 
ever  listened to lotte s chatter  when the time came he rose 
just as quietly and silently and went home to crude  there was 
also another daily visitor  lotte s neighbour pavle rankovid  he 
had long left off wearing national costume and now wore the  tight  
civilian dress  but he still stuck to his shallow red fez  he always 
wore a starched shirt with a stiff collar  and cuffs on which he noted 
down figures and accounts he had long ago succeeded in taking 
over the leading place in the visegrad trading community  his 
position was by now consolidated and assured  but not even he 
was without his cares and difficulties  like all the older men who 
had a certain amoxmt of property he was bewildered by the new 
times and the clamorous onrush of new ideas and new ways of 
life  thought and expression  all these things were embraced for 
him by the single word  politics   it was those  politics  that con  
fused and angered him and embittered those years which should 
have been years of respite and satisfaction after so much work 
and thrift and renunciation  he in no way wanted to stand aside 
or withdraw himself from the majority of his fellow countiymen  
but at the same time he had no wish to come into conflict with 
the authorities with whom he wished to remain at peace and at 
least outwardly in agreement  but that was difficult  almost impos  
sible  to achieve  he could not even understand his own sons as 
he should  like all the rest of the younpr generation they were 
simply baffling and incomprehensible to him  yet many older people 
either from necessity or weakness followed their example their 
bearing  behaviour and actions seemed to pavle rebellious as if 
they thought that to hve and die in present conditions was no 
better than to spend their lives like brigands in the mountains  
young people did not think what they said  paid no heed to what 
they did  did not count the cost and were careless in their work  
they ate their bread without stopping to think whence it came and 

    



talked  talked  talked   baying at the moon  as pavle expressed it 
in his arguments with his sons  

this way of thinking without limits  this speech without con  
sideration  and this life without calculation and hostile to every 
calculation  drove pavle  who had worked all his life by and with 
calculation  to frenzy and desperation he was filled with fear 
whenever he heard or saw them  it seemed to him that they 
imprudently and irresponsibly hacked away at the very foundations 
of life  at all that was dearest and most sacred to him  when he 
asked them for an explanation which would convince and reassure 
him they replied disdainfully and haughtily with vague and high 
sounding words  freedom  future  history  science  glory  greatness  
his skin crawled at all these abstract words  therefore he liked 
to sit and drink coffee with lotte  with whom he could talk 
about business and events  always based on a sure and admitted 
calculation  very different from the  politics  and the big  dangerous 
words that questioned everything  explained nothing and affirmed 
nothing  dunng the conversation he often took out his pencil stub  
not that of twenty five years back but one just as shiny and almost 
equally invisible  and put all that was said to the infallible and 
irrefutable proof of figures  they often recalled in their talk some 
long ago happening  or some jest in which nearly all the partici  
pants were now dead  and then pavle  bowed with cares  would 
go to his shop in the market place and lotte remained alone with 
her worries and her accounts  

lotte s personal speculations were in no better shape than the 
hotel s business  in the first years after the occupation it had been 
enough to buy any share in any enterprise and one could be sure 
that the money was well invested and the only question that could 
arise was the amount of the profit  but at that time the hotel 
had only just started work and lotte had neither the ready money 
at her disposal nor the credit which she later enjoyed  when she 
had achieved both money and credit the state of affairs on the 
exchanges had completely changed  one of the most serious of 
the cyclic crises had hit the austro hungarian monarchy at the 
end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century  
lotte s stocks and shares began to play like dust in a high wind  
she would weep with rage when she read the most recent quota  
tions each week in the vienna merkur  all the profits of the hotel  
which at that time was still doing good business  were not enough 
to cover the losses caused by the general decline in values  at 
that time too she had had a severe nervous breakdown which 
lasted a full two years she was almost mad with pain  she chatted 

    



to people without hearing what they said or thinking what she 
herself was saying she looked them full in the face but did not 
see them but the small print columns of the merkur which were 
to bring her good or evil luck then she began to buy lottery 
tickets since everything was in any case only a game of chance  
she might as well do it properly  she had lottery tickets from every 
country  she even succeeded in getting hold of a quarter share 
in a ticket of the great spanish christmas lottery whose first prize 
amounted to fifteen million pesetas she prayed god for a miracle 
and that her ticket should draw the first prize but she never 
won anything  

seven years before  lotte s brother in law zahler had gone into 
partnership with a couple of wealthy men on pension and founded 
the  modern milk co operative  in the town lotte provided three  
fifths of the capital business on a large scale was envisaged it 
was reckoned that the initial successes  which could not fail to 
eventuate  would attract capital from outside the town and even 
outside bosnia  but just at the moment when the enterprise was 
in its critical phase the annexation crisis took place this destroyed 
every hope of attracting fresh capital  these frontier districts 
became so unsafe that capital already invested in them began to 
flee  the co operative went into liquidation after two years  with 
the total loss of all the invested capital lotte had to mortgage 
her best and safest shares  like those of the sarajevo brewery and 
the solvaj soda factory at tuzla  to cover the deficit  

parallel with these financial misfortunes and allied to them 
were family troubles and disappointments  it was true that one 
of zahler s daughters  irene  had married unexpectedly well  lotte 
had provided the dowry   but the elder daughter  mina  remained  
embittered by the marriage of her younger sister and unfortunate 
in her suitors she had become before her time a vinegary and 
sharp tongued old maid to whom life at home and work in the 
hotel seemed even heavier and more unbearable than in fact they 
were  zahler who had never been lively or quick witted grew even 
more ponderous and indecisive and lived at home like a dumb 
but good natured guest from whom there was neither harm nor 
profit  zahler s wife  deborah  though sickly and in advanced years  
had given birth to a son  but the boy was backward and nckety  
he was now ten years old and still could not speak clearly or 
stand upright  but expressed himself in vague sounds and crawled 
about the house on his hands and knees but this miserable creature 
was so pitiable and good and clung so desperately to his aunt 
lotte  whom he loved far more than his mother  that lotte  despite 

    



all her worries and duties  looked after him  fed him  dressed him 
and sang him to sleep  with this cretin ever before her eyes  her 
heart contracted at the idea that busmess was now so bad that 
there was not enough money to send him to the famous doctors 
in vienna or into some mstitution  and at the thought that the days 
of miracles were past and that such creatures could not grow 
healthy by god s will or by man s good works and prayers  

lotte s galiaan dependents  whom she had educated or given 
in marriage during the good years  also caused her no little worry 
and disappointment  some amongst them had founded families  
extended their business and acquired property  lotte got regular 
news from them  letters filled with respect and gratitude and 
regular reports of the progress of their families  but the apfelmaiers 
to whom lotte had given a start in life  had educated or proidded 
homes for  did not help her or take any responsibility for new 
relatives born and growing up in poverty in galiaa but  once 
settled in distant cities  only bothered about themselves and their 
awn children  for them the greater part of their success lay in 
forgetting tarnow and the cramped and wretched circumstances 
m which they had grown up and from which they had had the 
luck to liberate themselves  as qmckly and as completely as possible  
and lotte herself was no longer able to set aside money as she 
had once done to give that black poverty of tarnow its chance 
in life  she never went to sleep or woke now without the thought 
that someone of hers in tarnow was forever sunk in the slough 
of hopeless poverty  condemned forever to ignorance and filth  in 
that shameful poverty which she knew so well and which she had 
fought against all her life  

even amongst those whose lot she had already improved there 
was reason enough for complaint and dissatisfaction  even the 
best among them had turned from the right path and made mistakes 
after their first successes and most shining hopes  one niece  a 
gifted pianist  who by lotte s help and encouragement had com  
pleted her studies at the vienna conservatoire  had poisoned herself 
a few years earlier at the time of her first and best successes  no 
one knew why  

one of her nephews  albert  lotte s pride and the hope of the 
family  had completed all his studies  both at secondary school and 
university  with outstanding success and only because he was a 
jew had not recdved his diploma  sab auspiciis regis  or obtained 
the imperial signet as lotte had secretly hoped  none the less  lotte 
had imag ed him at least as a leading lawyer in vieima or lwow  
since being a jew he could not become a senior dvil servant which 

    



would best have accorded with her ambitions  in such dreams 
she reaped the reward for all her sacrifices for his education  but 
there too she had had to suffer a painful disillusionment the young 
doctor of law went into journalism and became a member of the 
socialist party  and of that extremist wing which became notorious 
in the vienna general stnke of      lotte had to read with her 
own eyes in the viennese newspapers that  during the cleaning up 
in vienna of subversive foreign elements  the well known jewish 
agitator dr albert apfelmaier has been expelled  after first purging 
a sentence passed against him of twenty days  imprisonment  that  
in the language of the town  meant the same as if he had been a 
haiduk  a brigand  a few months later lotte received a letter from 
her dear albert in which he told her that he was emigrating to 
buenos aires 

in those days she could not find peace even in her own room  with 
the letter in her hand she went to her sister and brother in law 
and desperately  senselessly  flew into a passion with her sister 
deborah who could only weep she shouted with rage  

 what is to become of us  i ask you  what is to become of us  
when no one knows how to make his way and stand up for 
himself  unless they are propped up they all fall  what is going 
to happen to us  we are accursed  that is all there is to it   

 gott  gott  gott   wailed poor deborah with tears flowing down 
her cheeks  naturally quite unable to answer lotte s questions 
nor did lotte herself find an answer but clasped her hands and 
lifted her eyes to heaven  not weeping and frightened like deborah  
but furious and despairing  

 he has become a socialist  a soc   ial   isti isn t it enough that 
we are jews  but he must be that as well  o great and only god  
how have i sinned that you must punish us thus  a socialist   

she wept for albert as though he were dead and then never 
spoke of him again  

three years later one of her nieces  sister of that same albert  
married well in pest  lotte took charge of the trousseau and took 
a leading part in the moral crisis that this marriage provoked in 
the great apfelmaier family of tarnow  rich only in children 
and an unsullied religious tradition  the man whom this niece 
was to marry was a rich speculator on the bourse  but a christian 
and a calvinist  and he made it a condition that the girl should be 
converted to his faith  the relatives all opposed this but lotte  with 
the interest of the whole family in mind  said that it was hard to 
keep afloat with so many persons in the boat and that it was 
sometimes necessary to throw something overboard for the salva  

    



tion of all the rest  she supported the girl and her word was 
decisive the girl was baptized and married  lotte hoped that with 
the help of her new relative she would be able to introduce at 
least one of those cousins or nephews now of suitable age into the 
business world of pest  but bad luck had it that the rich pest 
speculator died in the first year of marriage  the young wife went 
almost mad with grief months passed and her great grief did not 
lessen the young widow had now been living in pest for four 
years  given over to her unnatural grief which amounted to a 
mild form of madness  the great  richly furnished apartment was 
swathed in black cloth she went every day to the cemetery  
sat by her husband s grave and read softly and devotedly to him 
the list of market quotations for the day from beginning to end  
to all suggestions made that she should awake from the lethargy 
into which she had fallen she answered softly that the dead man 
had loved that above all and that it had been the sweetest music 
he had ever known  

thus many destinies of all kinds accumulated in that little room 
there were many accounts  many doubtful bills  many others 
written off and expunged for ever in that great  many sided book  
keeping of lotte s  but the great principle of work remained the 
same lotte was tired but she was not discouraged  after every 
loss or failure  she would call on her resources  set her teeth and 
go on with the struggle in recent years she had been fighting a 
rearguard action but she went on struggling with the same aim 
before her eyes and with the same resolution as she had shown 
when she made money and went forward in the world  she was 
the  man  of that household and  aunt lotte  to the whole township  
there were still many both in the town and in the outside world 
who waited for her aid  her advice or at least her encouragement  
and who did not ask and could not imagine that lotte was tired 
but she was really tired  more than anyone suspected and more 
than she herself knew  

the little wooden clock on the wall struck one  lotte rose with 
difficulty  her hands on her hips  she carefully extinguished the 
great green lamp on the wooden side table and with the short steps 
of an old woman  steps she used only when she was in her own 
room and even then only when going to bed  she went to lie down  

there was complete and universal darkness over the sleeping 
town  


    



xxi 




i t is now       the last year in the chronicle of the bridge on the 
drina  it came as all earlier years had come  with the quiet 
pace of winter but with the sullen roar of ever new and ever 
more unusual events which piled upon one another like waves 
so many years had passed over the town and so man  more would 
still pass over it there had been  and there still w ould be  years of 
every sort  but the year      will always remain unique  so at 
least it seemed to those w ho lived through it to them it seemed 
that never would they be able to speak of all that they had seen 
then of the course of human destinies  however much  still con  
cealed by time and events  might be said or written about it later  
how could they explain and express those collective shudders 
which suddenly ran through all men and which from living beings 
were transmitted to inert objects  to districts and to buildings  
how could they describe that swirling current among men which 
passed from dumb animal fear to suicidal enthusiasm  from the 
lowest impulses of bloodlust and pillage to the greatest and most 
noble of sacrifices  wherein man for a moment touches the sphere 
of greater worlds with other laws  never can that be told  for 
those who saw and lived through it have lost the gift of words 
and those who are dead can tell no tales  those were things which 
are not told  but forgotten  for were they not forgotten  how 
could they ever he repeated  

in that summer of       when the rulers of human destinies 
drew european humanity from the playing fields of universal 
suffrage to the already prepared arena of universal military service  
the town of visegrad provided a small but eloquent example of 
the first symptoms of a contagion which would in time become 
european and then spread to the entire world that was a time on 
the limits of two epochs in human history whence one could 
more easily see the end of that epoch which was closing than the 
beginning of that new one which was opening then one sought 
for a justification for violence and found some name borrowed 

    



from the spiritual treasury of the past century for savagery and 
bloodlust  all that took place still had the outer semblance of 
dignity and the attraction of novelty  a terrible  short lived and 
inexpressible charm which later disappeared so completely that 
even those who then felt it so strongly could no longer evoke 
its memory 

but these are all things which we recall only in passing and 
which poets and scientists of coming ages will investigate  interpret 
and resurrect by methods and manners which we do not suspect 
and with a serenity  freedom and boldness of spirit which will be 
far above ours probably they will succeed m finding an explana  
tion even for that strange year and will give it its true place in the 
history of the woild and the development of humanity  but here 
it is unique for us  for above all that was the fatal year for the 
bridge on the drina 

the summer of      will remain in the memory of those who 
lived through it as the most beautiful summer they ever remembered  
for in their consciousness it shone and flamed over a gigantic and 
dark horizon of suffering and misfortune which stretched into 
infinity  

that summer did in fact begin well  better than so many earlier 
summers the plums ripened as they had not done for long before  
and the wheat promised a good harvest after ten years or so of 
troubles and commotions  the people hoped for at least a lull and 
a good year which would recompense in every way for the harms 
and misfortunes of earlier years  the most deplorable and tragic 
of all human weaknesses is undoubtedly our total incapacity for 
seeing into the future  which is m sharp contrast to so many of 
our gifts  our skills and our knowledge   

sometimes there is such a year when the heat of the sun and 
the moisture of the earth combine  and the whole visegrad valley 
trembles from the suberabundance of its force and the universal 
urge towards fecundity the earth swells and everything in it 
bursts vigorously into buds and leaves and blossoms and brings 
forth fruit a hundredfold  that breath of fertility could easily be 
seen quivering like a warm blue cloud over every furrow and every 
heap of earth  the cows and goats walked with hindlegs astraddle 
and moved with difficulty because of swollen and brimming udders  
the fish in the river which every year at the beginning of summer 
came in shoals down the rzav to spawn at its mouth were in 
such numbers that the children scooped them out of the shallows 
in buckets and threw them on to the bank  the porous stone of 
the bridge became softer and as if it were alive swelled with the 


    



force and abundance which beat upwards from the soil and hovered 
over the whole town in the heat of the dog days m which every  
thing breathed more quickly and matured more vigorously  

such summers were not frequent in the visegrad valley  but 
when one occurred  men forgot all the bad days that had been and 
did not even think of the misfortunes which might still be in store  
but lived with the threefold intensity of the life of the valley 
upon which the blessings of fertility had fallen  themselves only 
a part in that game of moisture and heat and ripening juices  

even the peasants who always found occasion to complain of 
something had to agree that the year had fruited well  but to every 
word of praise they added the qualification   if this weather 
holds         the merchants of the market place threw themselves 
headlong into business like bees into the cups of flowers they 
scattered into the villages around the town to make deposit pay  
ments on wheat in the ear and plums still in blossom  the peasants  
bewildered by this invasion of eager buyers  as well as by the 
large and exceptional yield  stood beside their fruit trees already 
bending under the weight of fruit or beside the fields which were 
like waves in the wind  and could not be sufficiently prudent and 
restrained to deal with the townsmen who had taken the trouble 
to come to visit them  that prudence and restraint gave their faces 
a shuttered and anxious expression  twin of that mask of woe 
worn by peasant faces in years of bad harvest  

when the merchants were rich and powerful  it was the peasants 
who came to them  on market days the shop of pavle rankovid 
was always full of peasants in need of ready money so too was 
the shop of santo papo who had for long been the leading figure 
among the visegrad jews  for even despite the fact that banks  
mortgage banks and other credit facilities had long existed in the 
town  the peasants  especially the older ones  liked to commit 
themselves in the old fashioned way with the merchants from 
whom they bought their goods and with whom their fathers before 
them had contracted obligations  

santo papo s shop was one of the highest and most solid in the 
visegrad market  it was built of stone  with thick walls and a 
floor of stone flags  the heavy doors and window shutters were of 
wrought iron and there were thick close grilles on the tall and 
narrow windows  

the front part of the building served as a shop along the walls 
were wooden shelves filled with enamel ware from the ceiling  
which was exceptionally high  so that it was lost in the gloom  
himg lighter goods  lanterns of all sizes  coffee pots  traps  mouse  

    



traps and other objects of twisted wire all these hung in great 
bunches  around the long counter were piled boxes of nails  sacks 
of cement  plaster and various paints  hoes  shovels and mattocks 
without handles were strung on wire in heavy garlands  in the 
comers were large tin containers with paraffin  turpentine and 
lamp black  it was cool there even in the height of summer and 
even at noon was dark and gloomy  

but most of the stock was in the rooms behind the shop  through 
a low entry with iron doors  the heavy goods were kept there  
iron stoves  crowbars  ploughshares  picks and other large tools  
they were all piled up in great heaps so that one could only walk 
between the piled goods along the narrow paths as if between high 
walls perpetual darkness reigned there and no one entered save 
with a lantern 

a chill dank air of stone and metal  which nothing could warm 
or disperse  exuded from the thick walls  stone ceiling and piled 
up iron  that air in a few years transformed the lively and red  
cheeked apprentices into silent  pale and puffy assistants  but made 
them skilful and thrifty  it was undoubtedly harmful also to the 
generations of shopkeepers but it was at the same time sweet and 
dear to them since it meant the feeling of property  the thought 
of gain and the source of riches 

the man who now sat in the front part of the cool  half lit 
shop at a small table beside a great green wertheim safe in no 
way resembled that turbulent and vivacious santo who had once  
thirty years before  had his own special way of shouting  rum for 
corkan    the passage of years and the work in the shop had 
changed him  now he was heavy and ponderous and yellow in 
the face  dark rings about his eyes stretched half way down his 
cheeks  his eyes had grown weak  those black and protruding eyes 
which now peered out from behind spectacles with thick lenses 
and metal rims  with a severe and yet timid expression he still 
wore his cherry coloured fez as a last remnant of his one time 
turkish costume his father  mente papo  a wizened and bald old 
man in his eighties  was still m reasonable health though his sight 
was failing  he would come to the shop on sunny days with his 
watery eyes which seemed to be melting away behind thick 
spectacles he would look at his son seated by the safe and his 
grandson at the counter  breathe in that aroma of his shop and 
then return home at a slow pace  his right hand resting on the 
shoulder of his ten year old great grandson  

santo had six daughters and five sons  most of them married 
his eldest son  rafo  already had grown up children who helped 

    



his father in the shop  one of rafo s sons  who bore his grand  
father s name  was at the sarajevo secondary school  he was a 
pale  short sighted and slender youth who at the age of eight had 
known perfectly how to recite the poems of the patriotic poet 
zmaj  but otherwise was not good at his studies  did not like to go 
to the synagogue or help in his grandfather s shop during the 
holidays and said that he was going to become an actor or some  
thing equally famous and unusual  

santo sat bowed over the huge  worn and greasy counter with 
an alphabetical ledger  and in front of him  on an empty nailbox  
squatted the peasant ibro cemanovid of uzavnica  santo was reckon  
mg up how much ibro already owed him and therefore how much 
and on what conditions he could obtain a fresh loan  

 smquenta  sinquenta i ocho       sinquenta i ocho  sesienta i 
tres          santo whispered  reckonmg in ladino spanish  

the peasant watched him with anxious anticipation as if watching 
an mcantation and not listening to the account which he already 
knew to the last para and which ran through his head even when 
he was asleep  when santo finished and announced the amount 
of the loan with interest  the peasant murmured slowly   will 
that be so        merely to gain time enough to compare his own 
reckoning with santo s  

 so it is  ibraga  and in no way different   replied santo in the 
formula time honoured in such cases  

after they had agreed on the state of present indebtedness  the 
peasant had to demand a fresh loan and santo to make clear the 
likelihood and the conditions  but that was no rapid or easy task  
a conversation developed between them  similar in the minutest 
detail to the conversations which  ten years ago or more  also before 
the harvest  had been held in this same spot between the father 
of ibro from uzavnica and santo s father  mente papo  the main 
subject of the conversation would be broached in a torrent of 
words which meant nothing in themselves and which seemed 
entirely superfluous and almost senseless  anyone uninitiated  
looking at them and listening to them  might easily have thought 
that the talk had nothing to do with money or a loan  or at least 
so it often appeared  

the plums are well forward and brought forth much fruit 
amongst us  even more than in any other district   said santo   it 
has been years since there was such a crop   

tes  thanks be  they have borne well enough  if allah permits 
the weather to hold there will be fruit and bread  one cannot 
deny it  only who knows what the price will be   said the anxious 

    



peasant  rubbing his thumb along the seam of his heavy green cloth 
trousers and looking at santo out of the corner of his eye  

 there is no way of telling that now  but we shall know by the 
time you bring them to visegrad you know the saying  the price 
is in the owner s hands   

 yes  that is so if allah allows them to ripen and mature   the 
peasant again qualified  

 without god s will  naturally  there is no gathering nor reaping  
however much man looks to what he has sown  it will avail him 
nothing if he have not god s blessing   broke in santo  raising 
his hand to heaven to show whence that blessing should come  
somewhere high above those heavy blackened rafters of the shop 
from which hung peasant lanterns of all sizes and bundles of other 
goods  

 it will avail nothing  you are right   sighed ibro  a man sows 
and plants but it is just as if  by the great and only god  he had 
thrown it all into the water  one digs  hoes  prunes and picks  but 
no  if it is not so written there will be no blessing on it but if 
god decides to give us a good harvest then no one will lack and a 
man may clear himself of debt and then become indebted once 
more  only let him keep his health   

 ah  yes  health is the mam thing nothing is as important as 
health so is man s life  give him everything and take health from 
him and it is as if he were given nothing   affirmed santo  turning 
the conversation in that direction  

then the peasant also expressed his views on health  which 
were just as general and commonplace as santo s  for a moment 
it seemed as if the whole conversation would be lost in futilities 
and generalizations  but at a favourable moment  as if by some 
ancient ritual  he returned to the opening question  then began 
the bargaining for a new loan  over the amount  the interest  the 
terms and the methods of payment they discussed it for long  
now vivaciously  now quietly and anxiously  but in the end they 
came to an agreement then santo rose  took a bunch of keys on 
a chain from his pocket and without removing them from the 
chain  unlocked the safe which began by creaking  opened slowly 
and solemnly and then  like all large safes  closed with a fine 
metallic noise like a sigh  he counted out the money to the peasant  
down to the copper hellers  all with the same care and attention  
with a solemnity that seemed a little sad  then in a changed and 
more animated voice  

 well  is that all right by you  ibraga  are you satisfied   

 yes  by god   the peasant replied quietly and pensively  



 may god send you blessing and profit  till we meet again 
in good health and good friendship  said santo  now quite lively 
and gay  and he sent his grandson to the cafe across the way for 
two coffees   one bitter  one sweet   

a second peasant was already awaiting his turn in front of the 
shop bound on the same errand and similar reckonings  

with these peasants and their reckoning about the coming harvest 
and the gathenng of the plums  the warm and heavy breath of 
an exceptionally fruitful year penetrated into the twilit gloom 
of santo s shop the green steel safe sweated from it and santo 
stretched the collar around his fat  soft  yellowish neck with his 
forefinger and wiped the steam off his spectacles with a hand  
kerchief  

so did summer begin  

but none the less at the very beginning of that year of blessing 
there fell a tiny shadow of fear and sorrow in the early spring  
at uvac  a small place on the former turco austrian frontier and 
the new serbo  austrian border  a typhus epidemic broke out  as 
the place was on the frontier and two cases had occurred in 
the gendarmerie station  the vlsegrad military doctor  dr balas  
went there with one male nurse and the necessary medicines  the 
doctor skilfully and resolutely did all that was necessary to isolate 
the sick  and himself undertook their treatment  of fifteen who 
had been taken ill only two died and the epidemic was limited 
to the village of uvac and stamped out at its source the last 
man to take ill was dr balas himself  the inexplicable manner in 
which he had caught the disease  the shortness of his illness  the 
unexpected complications and sudden death  all bore the stamp of 
genuine tragedy  

because of the danger of infection the young doctor had to be 
buried at uvac  madame bauer with her husband and a few other 
officers attended the funeral  she gave some money for a tombstone 
of roughly hewn granite to be erected over the doctor s grave  
immediately afterwards she left both the town and her husband 
and it was rumoured that she had gone to some sanitonum near 
vienna  this was the story current among the girls in the town  the 
older people  as soon as the danger had passed and the measures 
against the epidemic ceased  forgot both the doctor and the colonets 
lady  inexperienced and uneducated  the town girls did not know 
exactly what the word sanatorium meant  but they had known 
very well what it meant when two persons walked about the paths 
and foothills as the doctor and the colonel s wife had done until 
lately  pronouncing that strange word in their confidential dis  


    



cussions about the unhappy pair  they loved to imagine that sana  
torium as some sort of mysterious  distant and melancholy place 
in which beautiful and sinful women expiated their forbidden loves  

that exceptionally lovely and fruitful summer grew and matured 
over the fields and summits around the town  in the evening the 
windows of the officers  mess  over the river and by the bridge  
were lighted and wide open as in the previous year  only the sound 
of the piano and the violin no longer came from them  colonel 
bauer sat at his table with a few of his senior officers  good  
humoured  smiling and sweating from the effects of the red wine 
and the heat of the summer  

the young men sat on the kapia on warm nights and sang  it 
was nearly the end of june and the students were shortly expected 
to arrive  as they did every year  on such nights on the kapia 
it seemed as if time had stopped  while life flowed on endless  
rich and easy and one could not foresee how long it would con  
tinue thus  

at that time of the night the main streets were illuminated  for 
the town had had electric light since spring that year  about a 
year earlier an electrically driven sawmill had been built on the 
river bank about a mile from the town and beside it a factory for 
extracting turpentine from pine refuse  it also produced resin  
this factory had made an agreement with the municipality to 
light the town streets fiom its private power station  so the green 
lamp standards with their petroleum lights disappeared  and with 
them tall ferhat who used to clean and light them  the main 
street which stretched the whole length of the town  from the 
bridge to the new quarter  was lit by powerful lamps of white 
milky glass  while the side streets which branched off to right and 
left and meandered around bikavac or climbed upwards to mejdan 
and okoliste were lighted by ordmary bulbs between these lines 
of similar lights stretched long irregular patches of darkness  these 
were courtyards or large gardens on the slopes  

in one of these dark gardens zorka the schoolmistress was sitting 
with nikola glasijanin  

the dissension which had arisen between these two last year  
when stikovid had appeared at the time of the vacation  had lasted 
for long  right up to the beginning of the new year  then  as every 
winter  preparations for the festival of st sava had been begun 
in the srpski dom  a concert and a play were being prepared  
both zorka and glasidanin took part and returning home after 
the rehearsals they had spoken together for the first time since 
the previous summer  at first their talks had been short  reserved 

    



and distant  but they did not stop seeing one another  for young 
people prefer even the most bitter and hopeless of lovers  quarrels 
to the boredom and loneliness of a life without the play and 
thoughts of love somewhere in the course of their endless argu  
ments they had made peace  they themselves knew not how or 
when  now  on these warm summer nights  they met regularly  
from time to time the figure of the absent stikovi   rose between 
them and the whole pointless argument flamed up again  but it did 
not drive them apart  while every reconcihation drew them closer 
and closer together  

now they sat in the warm darkness on the stump of an old 
walnut tree and wrapped in their own thoughts looked down at 
the big and little lights of the town along the river which roared 
monotonously  glasifanin  who had been talking for a long time  
was now silent for a moment  zorka  who had been silent all 
evening  remained silent as only women know how when they are 
disentangling their love troubles in their minds  those troubles 
which are more intimate and more important to them than any  
thing else in life  

about this time last year  when stikovid had first appeared on 
the scene  zorka had thought that an endless paradise of happiness 
had opened before her  in which perfect affinity of feelings and 
unity of thought and desires had the sweetness of a kiss and the 
duration of a human existence  but that illusion had not lasted 
long  however inexperienced and enraptured she may have been  
she could not fail to notice that this man quickly took fire but 
equally quickly burnt out  according to his own ideas  without 
any consideration for her and without any connection with those 
things which she considered greater and more important than 
either herself or him  he had left her almost without saying good  
bye  she had been left a prey to indecision from which she suffered 
as from a hidden wound  the letter which had come from him had 
been perfectly phrased  a perfect example of literary skill  but 
as measured as a counsel s opinion and as clear and as transparent 
as an empty glass jar  in it he had spoken of his love  but as if the 
pair of them had aheady been a century in their graves  like persons 
famous and long dead to her warm and vivid reply came his card  
 in the tasks and anxieties which harass and annoy me i think 
of you as of a peaceful visegrad night  filled with the sound of the 
river and the perfume of unseen grasses  and that was all  in 
vain she tried to remember when she had heard the sound of the 
river and sensed the perfume of those unseen grasses  they existed 
only on his postcard  certainly she did not remember them  even 


    



as he  it seemed  did not remember anything that had taken place 
between them  her mind darkened with the thought that she had 
been deceived and that he had deceived her  and then consoled 
herself with something that she herself did not understand and 
which was less likely than a miracle   it is not possible to under  
stand him   she thought to herself   he is strange and cold  selfish  
moody and capricious  but perhaps all excepuonal men are like 
that   in any event what she felt was more like suffering than 
love  her inner flinching and the break that she felt in the depths 
of her being made it seem to her that the whole burden of that 
love which he had provoked lay upon her alone  and that he was 
lost somewhere far in the fog and the distance which she dared 
not call by its real name  for a woman in love  even when she has 
lost all her illusions  cherishes her love like a child she has not been 
destined to bear  she hardened her heart and did not reply to his 
card  but after a silence of two months another card arrived  it 
was written from some high mountam in the alps   at a height 
of       metres  surrounded by people of various tongues and 
nationalities  i look at the boundless horizon and think of you and 
last summer   even for her years and her little experience that 
was enough  had he written   i did not love you  i do not love you 
now  nor will i ever be able to love you   it could have been no 
clearer or more painful to her for when all was said and done  
it was love that was in question  not far off memories or how many 
metres above sea level a man was writing  nor what people were 
around him nor what languages they spoke  and there was nothing 
about love  

a poor girl and an orphan  zorka had grown up m visegrad 
with some relations  after she had finished her studies at the 
teachers  training college at sarajevo  she had been posted to 
visegrad and had returned to the house of the well to do but simple 
folk to whom she felt in no way attached  

zorka had grown thin and pale and had withdrawn into herself  
but she had confided in no one  and did not reply to his christmas 
message of greetings  which was equally short  cold and faultless 
in style she wanted to come to terms with her own grief and 
shame without anyone s help or consolation but  weak  discouraged  
young  ignorant and inexperienced  she became more and more 
involved m that inextricable net of real events and great desires  
of her ovm thoughts and his incomprehensible and inhuman 
behaviour  had she been able to ask anyone or to take anyone s 
advice  it would certainly have been easier for her but shame 
held her back  even so it often seemed to her that the whole town 


    



knew about her disappointment and that mocking and malicious 
glances seemed to bum into her as she walked through the market  
place  neither men nor books gave her any explanation  and she 
herself did not know how to explain anything  if he really did 
not love her why had there been all that comedy of passionate 
words and vows during the vacation last year  what had been 
the reason for that episode on the school bench  which could only 
be justified and defended by love  without which it fell into the 
mud of unbearable humihation  was it possible that there were 
men who respected themselves and others so little that they would 
enter lightheartedly into such a game  what drove them on if 
not love  what did his burning glances  his warm and halting 
breath  his passionate kisses mean  what could they mean  if 
not love  but it was not love  she saw that now  better and more 
clearly than she would have liked  but she could not resign herself 
truly and lastingly to such a thought  who has ever been able 
to resign themselves completely to it    the natural conclusion of 
all these internal conflicts was the thought of death which always 
lurks on the frontiers of every dream of happiness  to die  thought 
zorka  to slip from the kapia into the river as if by chance  without 
letters or farewells  without admissions or humiliations  to die  
she thought to herself in the last moments before going to sleep 
and on recovering consciousness in the morning  in the midst of 
the most lively conversations and beneath the mask of every smile  
everything in her said and repeated those words   to die  to die    
but one does not die  but lives with that insupportable thought 
within one  

comfort came from the source she least of all expected  some 
time about the christmas vacation her hidden torment reached its 
height  such thoughts and such unanswered questions destroy one 
even more than an illness  everyone noticed changes for the worse 
in her and worried about her  her relatives  her headmaster  a 
merry man with many children  and her friends  advising her to 
see a doctor  

good luck had it that just at this time were the rehearsals for 
the st sava festivities and that  after so many months  she again 
talked with glasicanin  up till then he had avoided every meetmg 
or conversation with her  but that goodwill that usually reigns at 
these naive but sincere dramatic and musical shows in small places  
and then the clear cold nights as they returned home  saw to it 
that these two young estranged persons should draw closer to one 
another  her need to lessen her torment drove her on and his love  
deep and sincere  drove him  


    



their first words were naturally cold  defiant  double edged  and 
their conversations long explanations without issue but even those 
brought solace to the girl for the first tune she could talk with 
a living being about her inner  shameful wretchedness without 
having to confess its most shameful and painful details  glasifanm  
spoke to her of it long and animatedly but with warmth and con  
sideration  saving her pride he did not express himself more 
harshly about stikovid than was inevitable  his explanation was 
such as v e have already heard that night on the kapia  it was short  
sure and unsparing stikovid was a born egoist and a monster  a 
man who could love no one and who as long as he lived  himself 
tormented and unsatisfied  would torture all those whom he 
deceived and who were near to him  glasicamn did not speak 
much of his own love  but it was evident in every word  every 
glance and every movement  the girl listened to him  remaining 
silent for the most part  after every such conversation she felt 
more serene  more at peace with herself  for the first time after so 
many months she had moments of respite from her internal storms 
and for the first time succeeded in looking at herself as other than 
an unworthy being  for the young man s words  filled with love and 
respect  showed her that she was not irretnevably lost and that 
her despair was only an illusion even as her dream of love the 
previous summer had been only an illusion  they had taken her 
out of that gloomy world in which she had already begun to 
lose herself and sent her back to living human reality  where there 
was healing and aid for everyone  or nearly everyone 

their talks continued even after the st sava celebrations  the 
winter passed and after it the spring  they saw one another almost 
every day  in time the girl came to herself  grew stronger and 
healthier  and was transformed  quickly and naturally  as only 
youth can be  so too passed that fruitful and uneasy summer  people 
were already accustomed to regard zorka and glasi anin as a 
couple who were  walking out   

it was true that the long speeches of glasiifanm to which she 
had at first listened avidly  drinking them in hke medicine  were 
now less mteresting  at times this need for mutual confession 
and confidence weighed on her  she asked herself with genuine 
wonder how this closeness between them had come about  but 
then she remembered that last winter he had  saved her soul  
and  mastering her boredom  listened to him like a good debtor  
as carefully as she could  

that summer night his hand was over hers  that was the ultimate 
limit of his modest daring   through that contact the warm richness 

    



of the night penetrated him also in such moments it was fully 
clear to him how much treasure was hidden in this woman and 
at the same time he felt how the bitterness and dissatisfaction of 
his life was being transformed into fruitful power sufficient to 
take two people to even the most distant goal  if love bound them 
and sustained them  

filled with those feelings in the darkness he was no longer the 
everyday glasijanin  a minor clerk of the great visegrad enterprise  
but quite another man  strong and self confident  who controlled 
his own life freely and far sightedly for a man filled with a 
great  true and unselfish love  even if it be on one side only  
there open horizons and possibilities and paths which are closed 
and unknown to so many clever  ambitious and selfish men  

he spoke to the woman beside him  

 i do not think i am mistaken  if for no other reason  then just 
because i should never be able to deceive you  while some talk 
and rave and others do business and make gains  i follow every  
thing and watch everything and i see more and more clearly that 
there is no sort of life here  for a long time there will be neither 
peace nor order nor profitable work  not even stikovid  not even 
herak  can create them  on the other hand  everything will get 
worse  we must get away from here  as from a house that is 
falling down these countless and uneasy saviours who pop up at 
every step are the best proof that we are heading for a catastrophe  
since we cannot help  we can at least save ourselves   

the girl remained silent 

 i have never spoken to you about this  but i have thought often 
and much  and have even done a little you know that bogdan 
djurovid  my fnend from okoliste  has now been in america for 
three years  i have been in correspondence with him since last 
year  i showed you the photograph he sent me he has asked me 
to come over there and has promised me a safe job at a good 
wage  i know that it is not a simple matter to do all this  but i 
do not think it is impossible  i have thought everything over and 
calculated everything  i will sell the little property i have up there 
at okoliste  if you will say yes  we will get married as soon as 
possible and leave for zagreb without saying anything to anyone  
there is a company there which arranges for emigrants to get 
to america  we could wait there until bogdan sends us an affidavit  
in the interval we could learn english  if we are not successful  
perhaps because of my military service  then we will cross over 
into serbia and leave from there i will arrange everything to make 
it as easy as possible for you in america we will both work  there 


    



are serbian schools there where you could teach  i would easily 
find work there  for over there all jobs are open and unrestricted  
we will be free and happy    will arrange everything  if only you 
would     if only you would agree   

the young man stopped  by way of answer she put both her 
hands on his in that he felt the expression of a great gratitude  
but her answer was neither yes nor no she thanked him for all 
his trouble and attention and for his boundless goodness and  in 
the name of that goodness  asked for a month before she gave 
him a definite answer  until the end of the school year  

thank you  nikola  thank you  you are good to me   she 
whispered  pressing his hands  

from the kapia below rose the sound of young men singing  they 
were visegrad youths  perhaps also some students from sarajevo  
in a fortnight the university students were due to arrive  until 
then she would not be able to come to any decision  everything 
made her suffer  most of all the goodness of this man  but at that 
moment she would not have been able to say  yes  even if she were 
to be cut to pieces  she no longer hoped for anything save to see 
once more  that man who can love no one   once more  and then 
let be what would  nikola would wait  that she knew  

they rose and  hand in hand  went slowly down the slope which 
led towards the bridge whence the singing came  


    



xxii 




o n vidovdan the serbs held their regular outing at mezalin  
under the dense walnut trees  at the the meeting of the 
two rivers drina and rzav  on the high green banks  tents 
were put up in which drinks were on sale and before which 
lambs were turning on spits over slow fires  families who had 
brought their lunch with them sat in the shade  below a canopy of 
fresh branches an orchestra was already playing on the well beaten 
open space there had been a kolo since morning only the youngest 
and idlest were dancing  those who had come here directly after 
morning service  straight from the church  the real general outing 
only began in the afternoon  but the kolo was already lively and en  
thusiastic  better and more vigorous than it would be later on when 
the crowd came  and married women  unsatisfied widows and young 
children began to take part and when everythmg was transformed 
into a single long and gay  but haphazard and disconnected  garland  
that shorter kolo in which more young men than girls were taking 
part was fast and furious  like a thrown lasso  everything around it 
seemed to be moving  swaying to the rhythm of the music  the air  
the thick crowns of the trees  the white summer clouds and the swift 
waters of the two rivers  the earth trembled under it and around it 
and seemed only to be trying to adapt its movement to the move  
ments of the young bodies  young men ran in from the main road to 
take their places in the kolo  but the girls restrained themselves and 
stood for a time watching the dancing as if counting the beats and 
waiting for some secret impulse in themselves  then they would 
suddenly leap in to the kolo with lowered heads and slightly bended 
knees as if eagerly leaping into cold water  the powerful current 
passed from the warm earth into the dancing feet and spread along 
the chain of warm hands  on that chain the kolo pulsed like a single 
living thing  warmed by the same blood and carried away by the 
same rhythm  the young men danced with heads thrown back  pale 
and with quivering nostrils  while the young girls danced with red  
dened cheeks and modestly downcast eyes  lest their glances betray 


    



the passion with which the dance had filled them  

at that moment  when the outmg had only just begun  a number 
of gendarmes appeared at the edge of the meadow  their black uni  
forms and weapons shining in the afternoon light there were more 
of them than was usual for the patrol which regularly visited fairs 
and outings they went straight to the canopy where the musicians 
were playing one after the other  irregularly  the players ceased 
the kolo wavered and stopped  young men s cries of protest could 
be heard the dancers stood hand in hand  some were so carried away 
and filled with the ihythm that they went on dancing where they 
were  waiting for the music to begin again but the players rose m 
haste and wrapped up their trumpets and their violins the gen  
darmes went on farther  to the tents and the families sitting on the 
grass everywhere the sergeant said his piece  in a low harsh voice  
and like some magic charm the gaiety faded away  the dancing 
ceased and conversations were broken off whomever they 
approached left the place where he had been till then  forgot what  
ever he was doing  gathered up his things as quickly as possible and 
left  the last to disperse was the kolo of youths and girls they did 
not want to abandon their dancing and could not get it into their 
heads that this was really the end of the gaiety and the outing but 
when they saw the white face and bloodshot eyes of the sergeant of 
gendarmes even the most obstinate slunk away  

disillusioned and perplexed  the people trailed back from mezalin 
along the wide  white road  the farther they went into the town the 
more they heard vague and frightened whispers about the assassina  
tion that morning at sarajevo and the death of the archduke franz 
ferdinand and his wife and the persecution of the serbs which was 
generally expected  in front of the municipal offices they came upon 
the first group of arrested men  amongst them the young priest 
mihailo  being taken to prison 

so the second part of that summer day  which should have been a 
festival  was transformed into a bewildered  bitter and frightened 
expectation  

on the kapia  instead of a festival mood and the gaiety of men re  
leased from work  there was the silence of the dead a guard had 
already been mounted  a soldier in a new uniform paced slowly 
from the sofa to the spot where the iron manhole covered the way 
down into the mined pier  he marched these five or six paces inces  
santly  and at each turn his bayonet glinted in the sun like a signal  
the next day  beneath the plaque with the turkish inscription  a 
white official notice appeared on the wall  printed in large letters 
and surrounded by a thick black border  it announced the news of 

    



the assassination and death in sarajevo of the crown prince and ex  
pressed the indignation roused by this evil deed  none of the passers  
by stopped to read it  but passed in front of the notice and the guard 
as quickly as possible with lowered heads  

from that time onward the guard remained on the bridge  the 
whole life of the town was suddenly interrupted  like the kolo at 
mezalm and that july day which should have been a day of festivity  

the days to come were strange  filled with the avid reading of 
newspapers  of whispers  of fear and defiance  the arrests of serbs 
and suspect travellers and the rapid reinforcement of military 
measures on the frontiers  the summer nights passed  but without 
song  without meetings of young men on the kapia and without the 
whispering of couples in the darkness  in the town mainly soldiers 
were to be seen  at nine o clock at night when the buglers sounded 
the melancholy notes of the austrian last post in the cantonments 
at bikavac and in the great barracks by the bridge  the streets were 
almost entirely deserted  those were bad times for young lovers 
eager to meet and have private conversations every evening 
glasijanin passed zorka s house  she was sitting at an open window 
on the ground floor there they talked  but only for a short time  
since he was in haste to cross the bridge and return to okoliste be  
fore nightfall  

so it happened that evening also  pale  hat in hand  he begged the 
girl to come out to the gate for he had something private to tell her  
after some hesitation she came  standing on the threshold of the 
courtyard she was now level with the youth who spoke excitedly in 
a scarcely audible whisper  

 we have decided to flee  this evening  vlado marid and two 
others  i thmk that we have foreseen everything and that we shall 
get across  but if not     if something should happen zorka   

the young man s whisper ceased  in her wide open eyes he saw 
fear and embarrassment  he was deeply moved as if he regretted 
that he had spoken to her and come to say goodbye  

 i thought it better to tell you   

thank you  then there is nothing of our       nothing of america   

 no  not  nothing   had you consented when i suggested a month 
ago that we should finish the matter at once  then perhaps we might 
already be far away from here  but perhaps it is better this way  now 
you can see what the position is    must go wdth my friends  the war 
is here already and there is need for all of us in serbia  i must  zorka  
i must  it is my duty  if i come out of all this alive and if we become 
free  then it may no longer be necessary to go across the sea to 
america  for we shall have our own america here  a land in which 


    



a man may work hard and honestly and live well and freely  there 
will be a life m it for both of us  if only you will consent  it will de  
pend on you  i will     i will think of you over there  and you  and 
you       sometimes     

words failed him and he suddenly put up his hand and quickly 
stroked her rich chestnut hair  that had always been his greatest 
desire and now  like a condemned man  he felt permitted to fulfil it  
the girl withdrew in fright and he remained with his hand in the air  
the gate shut silently and a moment later zorka appeared at the 
window  pale  with wide open eyes and feverishly twisting fingers  
the young man came close up to the window  threw his head back 
and revealed his face  laughing  carefree  almost handsome  as if 
afraid to see what would happen next  the girl drew back into the 
room which was already dark  there she sat down on her bed  bent 
her head and began to weep  

at first she w ept quietly and then more and more unrestrainedly 
with a feeling of heavy  universal hopelessness the more she wept  
the more reason she found to weep as everything around her seemed 
more and more hopeless  there was no way out  no solution  never 
would she be able to love  truly and as he deserved  that good and 
honest nikola who was going away  never would she live to see the 
day when that other one  who could love no one  should love her  
never again would she see those lovely  happy days which she had 
passed only last year in this town  not a single one of the serbs would 
ever succeed in coming alive out of that dark circle of mountains  nor 
would see america  nor would create here a land where  so they 
said  a man could work hard and live freely  never  

next day the news spread that vlado marid  glasidanin and a few 
other young men had fled to serbia all the other serbs wdth their 
families  and all that they had  remained in that overheated valley 
as in a trap  every day the atmosphere of danger and menace could 
be felt to be growing denser over the town  then  in the last days of 
july  the storm burst over the frontier  a storm which would in time 
spread to the whole world and decide the fate of so many lands and 
cities  as well as that of the bridge on the drina  

only then began the real persecution of the serbs and all those 
connected with them  the people were divided into the persecuted 
and those who persecuted them  that wild beast  which hves in man 
and does not dare to show itself until the barriers of law and cus  
tom have been removed  was now set free  the signal was given  the 
barriers were down  as has so often happened in the history of man  
permission was tacitly granted for acts of violence and plunder  even 
for murder  if they were carried out in the name of higher interests  

    



according to established rules  and against a limited number of men 
of a particular type and belief  a man who saw clearly and with 
open eyes and was then living could see how this miracle took place 
and how the whole of a soaety could  in a single day  be transformed  
in a few minutes the busmess quarter  based on centunes of tradi  
tion  was wiped out  it is true that there had always been concealed 
ennuties and jealousies and religious intolerance  coarseness and 
cruelty  but there had also been courage and fellowship and a feeling 
for measure and order  which restrained all these instincts within the 
limits of the supportable and  in the end  calmed them down and 
submitted them to the general interest of life in common  men who 
had been leaders in the commercial quarter for forty years vanished 
overnight as if they had all died suddenly  together with the habits  
customs and institutions which they represented  

the day after the declaration of war on serbia a scbutzkorps squad 
began to patrol the town  this squad  hastily armed and intended to 
assist the authorities in their hunt for serbs  was made up of gipsies  
drunkards and other persons of ill repute  mainly those who for long 
had been at odds with society and the law  a certain huso kokogar  
a gipsy without honour or definite occupation  who had lost his nose 
in early youth as a result of a shameful disease  led the dozen or so 
ne er do wells armed with old fashioned werndl rifles with long 
bayonets  and lorded it over the market place 

faced with this threat  pavle rankovid  as president of the serbian 
church and school community  went with a number of other lead  
ing members to the sub prefect sabljak  sabljak was a pale  puffy 
man  completely bald  bom in croatia  who had only recently been 
appointed to visegrad  now he was excited and he had not slept well  
his eyelids were reddened and his lips dry and bloodless  he was 
wearing high boots and in the lapel of his huntsman s coat wore some 
badge in two colours  black and yellow  he received them standing 
and did not offer them seats  pavle  yellow in the face  his eyes like 
two thin black slits  spoke in a hoarse unfamiliar voice  

 sir  you see what is going on and what is being prepared  and you 
know that we  serbs and citizens of vifegrad  have not wanted this   

 i know nothing  sir   the prefect curtly mterrupted him in a voice 
harsh with vexation   and i want to know nothing  we have other  
more important  things to do now than listen to speeches  that is all 
i have to say to you   

 sir   pavle began again calmly as if trying by his own calm to 
moderate even this irritable and angry man   we have come to offer 
you our services and to assure you         

 i have no need of your services and there is nothing for you to 

    



assure me about you have shown at sarajevo what you can do 
 sir   continued pavle resolutely and with unchanged voice   we 
would have liked within the limits of the law      

 so  now you remember the law  to what laws have you the 
effrontery to appeal         

 the laws of the state  sir  which apply to all   

the prefect suddenly became serious as if he had calmed down a 
little pavle at once took advantage of this moment of calm 
 sir  permit us to ask you whether w e may be sure that our lives 
and property and those of our families will be respected  and if not  
what we should do   

the prefect spread out his hands  palms upward  shrugged his 
shoulders  closed his eyes and convulsively shut his thin  pale 
lips  

pavle knew only too well this characteristic gesture  pitiless  blind  
deaf dumb  which state officials adopt in important moments and 
saw at once that it was no use going on talking the prefect  after 
lowering his hands  looked up and said more gently  

 the military authorities will advise everyone what they must do   
now it was pavle s turn to spread out his hands  close his eyes and 
shrug his shoulders for a moment  and then say in a deep  changed 
voice  

 thank you  sir   

the representatives bowed stiffly and clumsily   then they filed out 
like condemned men  

the market place was filled with aimless movement and secret 
consultations  

in alihodja s shop were sitting a number of prominent turks  
nailbeg turkovid  osmanaga sabanovid and suljaga mezildjid   they 
were pale and worried  with that heavy  fixed expression which can 
always be seen on the faces of those who have something to lose 
when faced with unexpected events and important changes  the 
authorities had called on them to place themselves at the head of 
the schutzkorps  now they had  as if by chance  met here to discuss 
without being overheard  what they ought to do  some were for 
accepting  others for holding back  alihodja  red in the face  excited  
with the old light in his eyes  resolutely opposed any idea of partici  
pation in the schutzkorps  he addressed himself especially to nailbeg 
who was for taking up arms since they  as leading citizens  should 
place themselves at the head of the moslem volunteer detachments 
instead of a bunch of gipsies  

 i will never mix myself up in their affairs as long as i am alive 
and you  if you had any sense  would not do so either  can t you see 

    



that these vlachs are only making use of us and that  in the end  it 
will all come back on our own heads   

with the same eloquence as he had once used in opposing osman 
effendi karamanli on the kapia he showed them that there was noth  
ing good  for the turkish ear  on either side and that every interven  
non on their part could only be harmful  

 for a long time past no one has asked us about anything or paid 
the least heed to our opinions  the schwabes entered bosnia and 
neither sultan nor kaiser asked   by your leave  begs and gentle  
men    then serbia and montenegro  until yesterday our serfs  rose 
in revolt and took away half the turkish empire and still no one 
ever thought about us  now the kaiser attacks serbia and once again 
no one asks us anything  but only gives us nfles and trousers to make 
us schwabe decoy ducks and tells us to hunt the serbs lest they should 
tear their own trousers climbing sargan  can t you get that into your 
heads  since no one has ever asked us about so many important 
things over so many years  this sudden favour is enough to make one 
burst one s ribs laughing  i tell you  there are big things at stake and 
it is best for him who does not get himself mixed up in them more 
than he must  here on the frontier they have already come to grips 
and who knows how far it will spread  there must be someone be  
hind this serbia  it could not be otherwise  but you  up at nezuke  
have a mountain in front of your windows and can see no farther 
than its stones  better give up what you have begun  don t go into 
the schutzkorps and don t persuade others to go  better go on milk  
ing the dozen serfs you have left while they still bring you in some  
thing   

all were silent  senous and motionless  nailbeg too was silent  he 
was obviously offended  though he concealed it  pale as a corpse  he 
was turning over some decision in his mind  save for nailbeg  ah  
hodja had undecided them and cooled their ardour  they smoked 
and silently watched the endless procession of military wagons and 
laden packhorses crossing the bridge  then  one by one  they rose 
and made their farewells  nailbeg was the last  to his sullen greet  
ing  alihodja once more looked him in the eyes and said almost 
sadly 

 i see that you have made up your mind to go  you too want to 
die  and are afraid lest the gipsies get in first  but remember that long 
ago old men said   the time has not come to die but to let it be seen 
of what stuff a man is made   these are such times   

the square between the hodja s shop and the bridge was crammed 
with carts  horses  soldiers of all kinds and reservists coming to re  
port  from time to time the gendarmes would lead a group of bound 

    



men across it  serbs  the air was filled with dust  everyone yelled at 
the top of his voice and moved about more quickly than the occasion 
demanded  faces were flushed and running with sweat  curses could 
be heard in all languages  eyes were shining with drink and from 
sleepless nights and that troubled anxiety which always reigns in the 
presence of danger and bloody events  

in the centre of the square  directly facing the bridge  hungarian 
reservists in brand new uniforms were hewing some beams  ham  
mers sounded and saws were busy cutting  around them a group of 
children had gathered  from his shop window alihodja watched two 
beams being set upright  then a mustachioed hungarian reservist 
scrambled up them and placed a third horizontally across the top  
the crowd pressed around them as if halva were being given away  
forming a living circle around the gallows  most of them were 
soldiers  but there were also some turkish village wastrels and gipsies 
from the town  when all was ready a way was made through the 
crowd and a table was brought and two chairs for the officer and his 
clerk  then the schutzkorps brought first two peasants and then a 
townsman  the peasants were village serfs from the frontier villages 
of pozderci   and kamenica and the townsman a certain vajo  a man 
from the lika  who had long ago come to the town as a contractor 
and had married there  all three were bound  haggard and covered 
with dust  a drummer was standing by  waiting to give a roll on his 
drums  in the general flurry and commotion the noise of the drum 
sounded like distant thunder  silence fell on that circle around the 
gallows  the officer  a hungarian reserve lieutenant  read in a harsh 
voice the sentences of death in german  they were then translated 
by a sergeant  all three had been sentenced to death by a summary 
court  for witnesses had declared on oath that they had seen them 
giving light signals by night towards the serbian frontier  the hang  
ing was to be carried out publicly on the square facing the bridge  
the peasants were silent  blinking as if in perplexity  vajo  the man 
from lika  wiped the sweat from his face and in a soft sad voice 
swore that he was innocent and with frenzied eyes looked around 
him for someone to whom he could still say it  

just at that moment when the sentence was about to be carried 
out there burst through the crowd of onlookers a soldier  small and 
reddish  with legs bowed like an x  it was gustav  the one time 
zablkelner in lotte s hotel and now a cafdowner in the lower 
market place  he was in a new imiform with a corporal s stripes  his 
face was flushed and his eyes more bloodshot than usual  explana  
tions began  the sergeant began to hustle him away but the bellicose 
caf  owner held his gro md  


    



 i have been an intelligence agent here for fifteen years  in the 
confidence of the highest military circles   he shouted in german in 
a drunken voice   only the year before last in vienna   was promised 
that i could hang two serbs with my own hands when the time came  
you don t know with whom you have to deal  i have earned my 
right to       and now you        

there were murmurs and whispers m the crowd  the sergeant 
stood in perplexity not knowing what to do  gustav became even 
more aggressive and demanded that two of the condemned men be 
handed over to him so that he could hang them personally  then the 
lieutenant  a thin dark man with the manner of a gentleman  as de  
spairing as if he were himself one of the condemned men  without a 
drop of blood in his face  rose  gustav  even though drunk  stood to 
attention but his thin red moustaches quivered and his eyes rolled 
to left and right  the officer came close to him and thrust his head 
into that flushed face as if he would spit on it  

 if you don t get out of here at once  i will give orders for you to 
be bound and taken to prison  tomorrow you will report to the 
ofiicer of the day  do you understand  now get out  march   

the lieutenant had spoken in german with a hungarian accent  
quite softly  but so sharply and exasperatedly that the drunken 
caf  owner at once thought better of it and was lost in the crowd  
incessantly repeating his military greeting and muttering vague 
words of excuse  

only then did the attention of the crowd return to the con  
demned men  the two peasants  fathers of families  behaved exactly 
alike  they blinked and frowned from the sun and the heat of the 
crowd around them as if that were all that was troubling them  but 
vajo in a weak and tearful voice asserted his innocence  that his 
competitor was responsible for the charge  that he had never done 
any military service and never in his life  own that one could make 
signals with lights  he knew a little german and desperatedly imked 
word with word  trying to find some convincing expression to halt 
this mad torrent which had swept him away the day before and 
which now threatened to sweep him off this earth  innocent though 
he was  

 herr oberleutnant  herr oberleutnant  um gottes vnllen        ich  
unschuldiger mensch       viele kinder        unschuldig  liige  alles 
liige          lieutenant  in god s name      i am innocent       many 
children       innocent  lies      all lies    vajo chose his words as if 
searching for those which were right and could bring salvation  

the soldiers had already approached the first peasant  he quickly 
took off his cap  turned towards mejdan where the church was and 

    



rapidly crossed himself twice  with a glance  the officer ordered 
them to finish with vajo first  then the desperate man from lika  
seeing it was now his turn  raised his hands to heaven imploringly 
and shouted at the top of his voice  

 nein  nein  nicht  urn cottes willen  herr oberleutnant  sie wis  
sen       alles ist luge       gott      alles ltige   but the soldiers had 
already seized him by his legs and waist and lifted him on to the 
trestles under the rope 

breathlessly the crowd followed all that happened as if it were 
some sort of game between the unlucky contractor and the 
lieutenant  burning with curiosity to know who would win and who 
lose  

alihodja  who had up till then only heard meaningless voices and 
had no idea of what was happening in the centre of that circle of 
densely packed onlookers  suddenly saw the panic stricken face of 
vajo above their heads and at once leapt up to shut his shop though 
there was a specific order of the military authonties that all places 
of business must remain open  

fresh troops kept arriving in the town and after them munitions  
food and equipment  not only by the overcrowded railway line from 
sarajevo but also by the old carriage road through rogatica  horses 
and carriages crossed the bridge day and night and the first thing to 
meet their eyes was the three hanged men on the square  as the head 
of the column usually became wedged in the overcrowded streets  
this meant that the bulk of the column had to halt there on the 
bridge or in the square beside the gallows until those in front had ex  
tricated themselves  covered with dust  red faced and hoarse from 
furious shouting  the sergeants passed on horseback between the 
carts and laden packhorses  making desperate signals with their 
hands and swearing in all the languages of the austro hungarian 
monarchy and by all the sacred things of all recognized confessions  

on the fourth or fifth day  early in the morning  when the bridge 
was again crammed with supply vehicles which crawled slowly to  
wards the crowded market place  a sharp and unusual whistling was 
heard over the town and in the centre of the bridge  not far from the 
kapia itself  a shell burst on the stone parapet  fragments of stone 
and iron struck horses and men  there was a rush of men  a rearing 
of horses and a general flight  some fled forward into the market  
place  others back along the road whence they had come  im  
meffiately afterwards three more shells fell  two in the water and 
one more on the bridge among the press of men and horses  in a 
twinkling of an eye the bridge was deserted  in the emptiness so 
created could be seen  like black spots  dead horses and men  the 

    



austrian field arullery from the butkovo rocks tried to get the range 
of that serbian mountain battery which was spraying the scattered 
supply columns on both sides of the bridge with shrapnel  

from that day on  the mountain battery from panes continually 
pounded the bridge and the nearby barracks a few days later  again 
early in the morning  a new sound was heard from the east  from 
somewhere on gole   this sound was more distant but deeper  and 
incendiary shells fell even more frequently over the town these 
were howitzers  two in all  the first shots fell in the dnna  then on 
the open space before the bridge where they damaged the houses 
around  lotte s hotel and the officers  mess  and then regular salvos 
began to centre on the bridge and the barracks  within an hour the 
barracks was on fire  the mountain battery from panos sprinkled 
with shrapnel the soldiers trying to put out the fire  finally  they left 
the barracks to its fate  in the heat of the day it burned as if made 
of wood  and shells fell from time to time into the burning mass and 
destroyed the interior of the building  so for the second time the 
stone han was destroyed and became once again a pile of stones  

after that the two howitzers from goles continually and regularly 
aimed at the bridge and especially the central pier the shells fell 
sometimes in the river  right and left of the bridge  sometimes 
smashed to pieces against the massive stone piers and sometimes hit 
the bridge itself  but none of them hit the iron manhole over the open  
ing which led into the interior of the central pier which held the 
explosive charge for mining the bridge  

in all that ten days long bombardment no major damage was done 
to the bridge  the shells struck against the smooth piers and rounded 
arches  ricocheted and exploded in the air without leaving other 
marks on the stone than light  white  scarcely perceptible scratches  
the fragments of shrapnel bounced off the smooth firm stone like 
hail  only those shells which actually hit the roadway left little holes 
in the gravel but these could hardly be seen save when one was on 
the bridge itself  thus in all this fresh storm which had burst over 
the town  overturning and tearing up by the roots its ancient cus  
toms  sweeping away living men and inanimate things  the bridge re  
mained white  solid and invulnerable as it had always been

b ecause of the continual bombardment all movement across 
the bridge ceased by day  civilians crossed freely and even 
individual soldiers scurried across  but as soon as a slightly 
larger group began to move they were sprayed by shrapnel 
from panos after a few days a certain regularity was established  
the people took note of when the fire was strongest  when less and 
when it ceased altogether  and finished their more urgent tasks 
accordingly  so far as the austrian patrols would let them  

the mountain battery from panos fired only by day  but the 
howitzers from behind golel fired at night also and tried to hinder 
troop movements and the passage of supplies on both sides of the 
bridge  

those citizens whose houses were in the centre of the town  
near the bridge and the road  moved with their families to mejdan 
or other sheltered and distant quarters  to stay with relatives or 
friends and take refuge from the bombardment  their flight  with 
their children and their most necessary household goods  recalled 
those terrible nights when the  great flood  came upon the town  
only this time men of different faiths were not mingled together 
or bound by the feeling of solidarity and common misfortune  and 
did not sit together to find help and consolation in talk as at those 
times  the turks went to the turkish houses and the serbs  as if 
plague stricken  only to serbian homes  but even though thus 
divided and separated  they lived more or less similarly  crushed 
into other people s houses  not knowing what to do  with time 
ha n ging on their hands and filled with anxious and uneasy thoughts  
idle and empty headed like refugees  in fear of their lives and in 
uncertainty about their property  they were tormented by differing 
hopes and fears which  naturally  they concealed  

as in earlier times during the  great floods  the older people 
both among the turks and the serbs tried to cheer up those with 
them by jokes and stones  by an affected calm and an artificial 
serenity  but it seemed that in this sort of misfortune the old tricks 


    



and jokes no longer sared  the old stories palled and the witticisms 
lost flavour and meaning  and it was a slow and painful process 
to make new ones  

at night they crowded together to sleep  though in fact no one 
was able to close an eye  they spoke in whispers  although they 
themselves did not know why they did so when every moment 
there was above their heads the thimder of the gims  now serbian  
now austrian  they were filled with fear lest they should be 
 making signals to the enemy  although no one knew how such 
signals could be made nor what they in fact meant  but their fear 
was such that no one even dared to strike a match  when the men 
wanted to smoke they shut themselves up in suffocating little rooms 
wdthout windows  or covered their heads with counterpanes  and 
so smoked  the moist heat strangled and throttled them  everyone 
was bathed in sweat  but all doors were fastened and all windows 
closed and shuttered  the town seemed like some wretch who 
covers his eyes with his hands and waits for blows from which 
he cannot defend himself  all the houses seemed like houses of 
mourning  for whoever wished to remain alive had to behave as 
though he were dead  nor did that always help  

in the moslem houses there was a little more life much of the 
old warlike instincts remained but they had been awakened m 
an evil hour  embarrassed and pointless in face of that duel going 
on over their heads in which the artillery of the two sides  both 
christian  were takmg part  but there too were great and concealed 
anxieties  there too were misfortimes for which there seemed no 
solution  

alihodja s house tmder the fortress had been turned into a 
moslem religious school  to the crowd of his own children had 
been added the nine children of mujaga mutapdiid  only three 
of these were grown up and all the rest small and weak ranged one 
after the other differing by an ear  in order not to have to watch 
them or to call them at every moment into the courtyard  they 
had been shut up with alihodja s children in a large room and 
there their mothers and elder sisters dealt with them amid a con  
tinual flurry and fusillade of cries  

this mujaga mutapd i j  known as the  man from uhce   was a 
recent comer to the town  we shall see a little later why and 
how   he was a tall man in his fifties  quite grey  with a great 
hooked nose and heavily lined face  his movements were abrupt 
and military  he seemed older than alihodja although he was in 
fact ten years younger  he sat in the house with alihodja  smoked 
incessantly  spoke little and seldom and was wrapped up in his 


    



own thoughts whose burden was expressed in his face and his 
every movement  he could not remain long in any one place  
every so often he would rise and go outside the house and from 
the garden watch the hills around the town  on both sides of 
the river  he stood thus with head raised  watching carefully as 
if for signs of bad weather  alihodja  who never allowed him to 
remain alone  tried to keep him in conversation and followed him  

in the garden  which was on a steep slope but was large and 
beautiful  the peace and fecundity of the summer days reigned  
the onions had already been cut and spread out to dry  the sun  
flowers were in full bloom and around their black and heavy centres 
the bees hummed  at the edges the small flowerets had already 
gone to seed from that elevated place one could see the whole 
town spread out below on the sandy spit of land between the two 
rivers  drina and rzav  and the garland of mountains around  of 
unequal height and varied shapes  on the level space around the 
town and on the steep foothills scraps and belts of ripe barley 
alternated with areas of still green maize  the houses shone white 
and the forests that covered the mountains seemed black  the 
measured cannon fire from the two sides seemed like salutes  
formal and harmless  so gicat was the extent of the earth and 
the sky above it in the serenity of the summer day which had 
only just begun  

the sight loose  ed the tongue even of the care filled mujaga  he 
thanked alihodja for his kind words and told him the story of his 
own life  not that the hodja did not already know it  but mujaga 
felt that here in the sunlight he could lessen the tension that 
gripped and strangled him  he felt that his fate was being decided 
here and now on this summer s day by every roar of the guns 
from one side or the other  

he had been not quite five years old when the turks had had 
to leave the serbian towns  the osmanlis had left for turkey 
but his father  sulaga mutapdiid  still a young man  but already 
respected as one of the leading turks of u ice  had decided to cross 
into bosnia whence his family had come in olden times  he had 
piled the children into baskets and with all the money which 
in such circumstances he had been able to get for his house and 
lands he had left uiice forever  with a few hundred other 
u ice refugees he had crossed into bosnia where there was still 
turkish rule  and settled with his family in visegrad where a branch 
of the family had once lived  there he passed ten years and had 
just begun to consolidate his position in the market when the 
austrian occupation had taken place  a harsh and uncompromising 


    



man  he had thought it not worth his while to fly from one 
christian rule only to live under another one  so  a year after the 
arrival of the austrians  he had left bosnia with his whole family  
together with a few other families who had not wished to pass 
aeir lives  within the sound of the bell   and settled in nova varos 
in the sanjak  mujaga had then been a young man of little over 
fifteen there suljaga had gone on with his trading and there the 
rest of the children had been born  but he was never able to forget 
all he had lost in u   ice  nor could he get on with the new men 
and different manner of life in the sanjak  that was the reason 
for his early death his daughters  all pretty and of good reputation  
had married well his sons took over and extended the small 
inheritance left them by their father  but just when they had 
married and had begun to take deeper root in their new country 
came the balkan wars of       mujaga had taken part in the 
resistance put up by the turkish army against the serbs and mon  
tenegrins  the resistance was short but it was neither weak nor 
unsuccessful in itself  but none the less  as if by some charm  his 
fate  like that of the war itself and of many thousands of men  was 
not decided there but somewhere far away  independent of any 
resistance  strong or weak  the turkish army evacuated the sanjak  
not willing to await an adversary from whom he had already fled 
as a child from u   ice and whom he had now resisted without 
success  and having nowhere else to go  mujaga decided to return 
to bosnia under that same rule from which his father had fled  
so now  for the third time a refugee  he had come with his whole 
family to the town in which he had passed his childhood  

with a little ready money and with the help of the visegrad 
turks  some of whom were his relatives  he had managed to build 
up a small business over the last two years  but it was not easy 
for  as we have seen  times were hard and insecure  and profits 
diflscult to make even for those whose position was assured  he 
had been living on his capital while waiting for better and more 
peaceful times  now  after only two years of the hard life of a 
refugee in the town  this storm had broken in which he could do 
nothing and could not even think of what to do next  the only 
thing left to him was to follow its course anxiously and await 
fearfully its outcome  

it was of this that the two men were now talking  softly  inter  
mittently and disconnectedly  as one speaks of things already well  
known and which can be looked at from the end  the beginning or 
any point m the middle  alihodja  who liked and greatly respected 
mujaga  tried to find some words of solace or consolation  not 

    



because he thought that anything would help  but because he felt 
it his duty in some way to partake in the misfortune of this 
honourable and unfortunate man and true moslem  mujaga sat 
and smoked  the very image of a man whom fate has loaded too 
heavily  great beads of sweat broke out on his forehead and temples  
stood there some time until they grew big and hea y  then shone 
m the sim and overflowed like a stream down his lined face  but 
mujaga did not feel them nor brush them away  with dull eyes he 
looked at the grass in front of him and  wrapped up in his own 
thoughts  listened to what was happening within himself which 
was stronger and louder than any words of consolation or the 
most vigorous bombardment  from time to time he moved his 
hand a little and murmured something or other which was far 
more a part of his own inward conversation than any reply to 
what was being said to him or what was takmg place aroimd him  

this has come upon us  my alihodja  and there is no way out  
the one god sees that we  my father  peace be to him  and myself  
have done everything we could to remain in the pure faith and the 
true way of life  my grandfather left his bones in u ice and today 
we do not even know where he is buried  i myself buried my 
father in nova varo  and   do not know if by now the vlachs 
are pasturing their cattle over his grave  i had thought that i at 
least would die here  where the muezzin still calls  but now it 
seems that it is written that our seed will be extinguished and that 
no one knows where his grave will be  can it be that god s wishes 
are so  only now i see that there is no way out the time has come 
of which it is said that the only way left for the true faith is to 
die  for what can i do  shall i go with nailbeg and the schutzkorps 
and die with a schwabe rifle in my hands  shamed both in this 
and in the next world  or shall i wait and sit here until serbia 
shall come  and wait once more for all that we fled from as 
refugees fifty years ago   

alihodja was about to utter some words of encouragement that 
might provide a little hope  but he was interrupted by a salvo from 
the austrian battery on the butkovo rocks  it was immediately 
answered by the guns from panos  then those behind goles opened 
fire  they were firing low  directly over their heads  so that the 
shells wove a web of sound above them that catches at a man s 
entrails and tightens the blood vessels until they hurt  alihodja 
rose and suggested that they take refuge under the balcony  and 
mujaga followed him like a sleepwalker  

in the serbian houses huddled around the church at mejdan 
there were  on the other hand  no regrets for the past or fears 


    



for the future  there was only the fear and burden of the present  
there was a sort of special  dumb astonishment  that feeling which 
always remains among people after the first blows of a great terror  
with arrests and killings without order or justice  but beneath this 
consternation everything was the same as it had been earlier  
the same expectant waiting as before  more than a hundred years 
ago  when the insurgents  fires had burned on panos  the same 
hope  the same caution and the same resolution to bear everything 
if it could not be otherwise  the same faith in a good result some  
where at the end of all ends  

the grandchildren and great grandchildren of those who from 
this same hillside  shut up in their houses  anxious and frightened 
but moved to the depths of their being  had listened intently trying 
to hear the feeble echo of karageorge s gun on the hillside above 
veletovo  now listened in the warm darkness to the thunder and 
nimble of the heavy howitzer shells passing above their heads  
guessmg from the sound which were serbian and which austrian  
calling them endearing nick names or cursing them  all this while 
the shells were fiying high and falling on the outskirts of the 
town  but when they were aimed low at the bridge and the town 
itself everyone fell suddenly silent for then it seemed to them  and 
they would have sworn to it  that in that complete silence  in 
the midst of so much space around them  both sides were aiming 
only at them and the house in which they were  only after the 
thunder and roar of a nearby explosion had died away  they would 
begin talking again  but in changed voices  assuring one another 
that the shell which had fallen quite close was of a particularly 
devilish kind  worse than any other  

the merchants from the market place had for the most part 
taken refuge in the ristid house  it was immediately above the 
priest s house  but larger and finer  sheltered from the artillery 
fire by the steep slopes of the plum orchards  there were few men 
but many women  whose husbands had been arrested or taken 
as hostages  who had taken refuge here with their children  

in this rich and extensive house lived old mihailo ristid with 
his wife and daughter in law  a widow who had not wanted to 
marry again or return to her father s house after the death of her 
husband  but remained there with the two old people to bring 
up her children  her eldest son had fled to serbia two years before 
and been killed as a volunteer on the bregalnica  he had been 
eighteen years old  

old mihailo  his wife and daughto  in law served their unusual 
guests as if they were at a family feast  a slava  the old man 


    



especially was untinng  he was bareheaded  which was unusual  
for as rule he never took off his red fez his thick grey hair fell 
over his ears and forehead and his huge silvery moustaches  yellow 
at the roots from tobacco  surrounded his mouth like a perpetual 
smile whenever he noticed that anyone was frightened or more 
melancholy than the others  he would go up to him  talk to him 
and offer him plum brandy  coffee and tobacco 

 i can t  kum mihailo  i thank you like a father  but i can t  
it hurts me here   protested a young woman  pointing to her white 
and rounded throat  

she was the wife of peter gatal of okoli te  a few days before 
peter had gone to sarajevo on business there he had been caught 
by the outbreak of war and from that time onward his wife had 
had no news of him the army had driven them out of their house  
and now she and her children had taken refuge with old mihailo  
to whom her husband s family had long been related  she was 
broken down with worry about her husband and her abandoned 
home she wrung her hands  sobbing and sighing alternately  

old mihailo never took his eyes off her and kept near her always 
that morning it had been learnt that peter  on his way back from 
sarajevo by train  had been taken as a hostage to vardiste and 
there  after a false alarm of a revolt  had been shot in mistake  
that was still being kept from her  and old mihailo was doing his 
best to prevent anyone suddenly and inadvisedly telling her  every 
few moments the woman would rise and try to go into the court  
yard and look towards okoliste  but mihailo prevented her and 
talked her out of it by every possible means  for he knew very 
well that the gatal house in okoliste was already in flames and 
he wanted to spare the unfortunate woman this sight at least  

 come  stanoika  come  my lamb  just a little glass  this is not 
plum brandy  but a real balm and cure for all ills   

the woman drank it meekly  old mihailo went on offering food 
and drink to everyone present and his untiring and irresistible 
hospitality forced them all to take heart  then he went back to 
peter s wife  the plum brandy had in fact loosened the constriction 
in her throat  now she was calmer and only gazed pensively in 
front of her  mihailo would not leave her side  but went on talking 
to her as to a child  telling her how all this too would pass and 
her peter come back from sarajevo alive and well  and they would 
all go home again to their house at okoliste  

 i know peter  i was at his christening  they talked about that 
christening for a long time  i remember it as if it had been today  
i was a young man then  just ripe for marriage  when i went with 

    



my father  who was kum to janko s children  to christen that peter 
of yours  

he told the tale of the christening of peter gatal which everyone 
already knew but which in these strange hours seemed as if new 
to them  

the men and women drew closer to listen  and in listening 
forgot their danger and paid no attention to the sound of the 
guns as old mihailo told his tale  

in the good times of peace  when the famous pop nikola was 
pnest in the town  janko gatal of okoliste  after many years of 
marriage and a whole succession of daughters  had a son on the 
first sunday after the birth  they brought the child to be christened 
and besides the joyous father and the kum  a number of relatives 
and neighbours came too even on the way down from okoliste 
they stopped often and had a nip from the kum s big flat flask 
of plum brandy when on crossing the bridge they came to the 
kapia  they sat down for a short rest and another nip  it was a 
cold day in late autumn and there was no coffee maker on the 
kapia  nor had the town turks come there to sit and drink coffee  
therefore the people of okoliste sat down as if they were at home  
opened their bags of food and beean a fresh flask of plum brandy  
toasting one another cordially and eloquently  they forgot all about 
the baby and the priest who was to christen it after the service  
as in those days  the seventies of last century  there were still 
no bells  and dared not be  the merry party did not notice the 
passing of time and that the service had long been finished  in 
their conversations  wherein they boldly and at great length 
mingled the future of the baby with the past of its parents  time 
had no longer any importance or any measure  several times the 
conscience of the kum smote him and he suggested that they should 
move on  but the others silenced him  

 well  friends  let us ho and finish what we have to do  by the 
law and the christian faith   muttered the kum  

 why the hurry  in god s name  no one in this parish has ever 
stayed unchristened   answered the others and each offered him a 
drink from his flask  

the father too at one time tried to hurry them on  but in the 
end the plum brandy silenced and reconciled them all  his wife 
who up till then had been holding the baby in her arms which 
were blue from cold  now put it down on the stone seat and 
wrapped it in a coloured shawl  the baby was as quiet as if it 
were in its cradle  now sleeping  now opening its eyes inquisitively 
as if to take part in the general gaiety   one can see that he is 

    



a true townsman   said the kum   he loves good company and fun     

 your health  janko   shouted one of the neighbours   may your 
son be lucky and live long god grant that he do you honour among 
the serbs in all good and prosperity  god grant that         

 how would it be if we got on with the christening   interrupted 
the father  

 don t worry about the christening   they all cried and once 
more passed round the flask of plum brandy  

 ragib effendi borovac has never been christened either  but 
you see what a fellow he is  his horse bends under him   shouted 
one of the neighbours amid general laughter  

but if time had lost all meaning for the men on the kapia  it had 
not done so for pop nikola  who had till then been waiting in front 
of the church  but by this time had grown angry  he wrapped his 
fox skin cape about him and marched down from mejdan into 
the town there someone told him that the men with the child 
were on the kapia  he went there to give them a good browbeating  
as he well knew how  but they welcomed him with so much heart  
felt and sincere respect  with such solemn excuses and warm wishes 
and good words that even pop nikola  who was a hard and severe 
man  but a real townsman at heart  gave way and accepted a 
drink from a flask and some snacks he bent over the baby and 
called it little baby names  while the child looked up calmly at 
the huge face with its big blue eyes and broad reddish beard  

it was not quite true  as they said  that the little one was 
christened then and there on the kapia  but it is true that they stayed 
there a long time talking  drinking and proposing many toasts  
it was not until late in the afternoon that the whole gay company 
made its way up to mejdan and the church was opened and the 
kum  stuttering and unsure of his words  renounced the devil in 
the name of the new townsman  

 it was so we christened kum peter  may he remain safe and 
sound  he has now passed his fortieth year and as you see has lacked 
for nothing   old mihailo ended  

everyone accepted another coffee and a glass of plum brandy  
forgetting the reality of the moment which might sweep them all 
away  all talked more freely and easily  somehow it now seemed 
clear to them that there were other things in life  more joyful 
and human things  than this darkness  fear and murderous shooting  

so the night passed and with it life went on  filled with danger 
and suffering but still clear  unwavering and true to itself  led on 
by ancient inherited instinct they broke it up into momentary 
impressions and immediate needs  losing themselves completely in 

    



them  for only thus  living each moment separately and looking 
neither forward nor back  could such a life be borne and a man 
keep himself alive in hope of better days  

so the day broke  that meant only that the artillery fire became 
more intense and the senseless and incomprehensible game of war 
continued  for in themselves days no longer had either name or 
sense  time had lost all meaning and value  men knew only how 
to wait and to tremble  save for that  words  work and movements 
had all become automatic  

so  or similarly  did men live in the steep quarters below the 
fortress and at mejdan  

below  in the market place itself  few citizens had remained  
from the first day of the war there had been an order that all 
shops must remain open so that the soldiers in passing could make 
minor purchases  and even more to prove to the citizens that the 
war was far away and presented no danger to the town  that 
order had remained in force  no one knew why  even now during 
the bombardment  but everyone found some good excuse to keep 
his shop closed for the greater part of the day  those shops which 
were near the bridge and the stone han  like those of pavle rankovid 
and alihodja  were closed all day for they were too exposed to 
the bombardment  so too  lotte s hotel was completely deserted 
and closed  its roof had been damaged by shell fire and the walls 
pitted with shrapnel  

alihodja only came down from his house on the hill once or 
twice a day to see if everything were in order  and then returned 
home  

lotte and her whole family had left the hotel on the first day 
after the bombardment of the bridge began  they crossed to the 
left bank of the drina and took refuge there in a large new turkish 
house  the house was some way from the road  sheltered in a 
hollow and surrounded by dense orchards from which only its 
red roof emerged its owner vrith all his family had gone to the 
villages  

they had left the hotel at dusk  when as a rule there was a 
complete lull in the bombardment  of the staff  the only one who 
remained was the loyal and unchanging milan  an old bachelor 
but always immaculately turned out  for a long time past there 
had been no one for him to throw out of the hotel  all the others  
as often happens in such circumstances  had fied as soon as the first 
shell whistled over the town  as alwa rs  in this transplantation 
also  lotte had controlled and arranged eveiything  personally and 
without opposition  she decided what was most necessary and most 


    



valuable to take with them  and what to leave behind  what each 
should wear  who was to carry deborah s crippled and feeble minded 
son  who was to look after deborah herself  weeping and sickly  
and who take care of the portly mina  who was out of her mind 
from fear  so  taking advantage of the darkness of the hot summer 
night  all of them  lotte  deborah  zahler and mina  crossed the 
bridge with their few belongings and the sickly child on a push  
cart  with their cases and bundles in their hands  after thirty years 
the hotel was now for the first time completely closed and remained 
without a living soul in it darkened  damaged by the shell fire  
it already looked like a ruin  they too  as soon as they made their 
first steps across the bridge  aged or weak  cnppled or fat  bow  
legged or unaccustomed to walking  suddenly seemed like jewish 
refugees who had been walking all the roads of the world m search 
of refuge 

so they crossed to the farther bank and came to the big turkish 
house to spend the night  there too lotte arranged everything 
and put everything in order  their refugee luggage and them  
selves  but when it was time for her to lie down in that strange 
half empty room  without her things and her papers with which 
she had spent her life  her heart failed her and for the first time 
since she had been conscious of her own existence  her forces all 
at once gave way  her scream echoed through the empty turkish 
house  something that no one had ever heard or suspected could 
exist  lotte s weeping was terrible  heavy and stifled like that 
of a man  uncontrolled and uncontrollable  the whole family was 
overcome with astonishment  at first there was an almost religious 
silence and then a general weeping and wailing  for them the 
breakdown of aunt lotte s forces was a heavier blow than the 
war itself and the flight and the loss of home and property  for 
with her it was possible to surmount and overcome everything 
but without her they could think of nothing and do nothing  

when the next day dawned  a brilliant summer day  filled with 
the singing of birds  with rosy clouds and heavy dew  instead of the 
one time lotte  who up to the day before had controlled the 
destinies of all her family  there remained huddled on the floor 
a weak old jewess who could not look after or care for herself  
who diivered from reasonless fear and who wept like a child  not 
knowing how to say of what she was afraid or tell what it was 
that pained her  then another miracle took place  that old  cumber  
some  drowsy zahler  who even in his youth had never had a will 
of his own but had been content to let lotte guide him as she did 
all the rest of the family  who in fact had never been young  now 


    



revealed himself as the real head of the family  with much wisdom 
and resolution  capable of making the necessary decisions and 
with enough force to put them into practice  he consoled and 
looked after his sister in law like a sick child and took care of 
everyone as she had done nght up to the day before  he went down 
into the town during a lull in the bombardment and brought 
necessary food  goods and clothing from the deserted hotel  he 
found a doctor somewhere and brought him to the sick woman  
the doctor diagnosed that the sick old woman had had a complete 
nervous breakdown  and said that she should be taken somewhere 
else as qiuckly as possible  outside the area of military operations  
and prescribed some drops  zahler arranged with the military 
authorities to get a cart and transport the whole family first to 
rogatica and then to sarajevo  it was only necessary to wait a 
day or two until lotte was fit to travel  but lotte lay as if paralytic  
wept at the top of her voice and muttered m her picturesque and 
mangled language disconnected words of utter desperation  fear 
and repulsion  deborah s imlucky child crawled around her on 
the bare floor  looked inquisitively into his aunt s face and called to 
her with those mcomprehensible cries which lotte had once under  
stood so well and to which she did not now reply  she refused 
to eat anything or to see anyone  she suffered terribly from strange 
hallucinations of purely physical suffenng  sometimes it seemed 
to her that two planks beneath her suddenly opened like a trap  
door and that she fell between them into an unknown abyss and 
that  save for her own screams  there was nothing to save her 
and support her  at other times it seemed to her that she had in 
some way become huge  but light and very strong  as if she had 
giant s legs and powerful wmgs and ran like an ostrich  but with 
steps longer than from visegrad to sarajevo  the seas and rivers 
splashed under her tread like puddles  and towns and villages 
cracked under her steps like gravel and glass  that made her heart 
beat fiercely and her breath come in gasps  she did not know where 
that winged race would take her nor where it would stop  she only 
knew that she was escaping from those deceivmg planks which 
opened beneath her with the speed of lightning  she knew that 
she trod down and left behind her a land in which it was not 
good to stay and that she stepped over villages and great towns in 
which men lied and cheated with words and figures  when their 
words became mvolved and their figures entangled  they at once 
changed their game  as a conjuror changes his scene  and contrary 
to all that had been said or was expected  guns and rifles advanced 
with other  new men with bloodshot eyes with whom there 


    



could be no conversation  no compromise and no agreement  
faced with this invasion she was suddenly no longer a powerful 
and giant bird that ran  but a weak  defenceless poor old woman on 
the hard floor  and these people came in hordes  in thousands  in 
millions  they shot  they cut throats  they drowned people  they 
destroyed without mercy or reason  one of them was ben ng over 
her  she could not see his face but felt the point of his bayonet 
pressed on that spot where the ribs separate and a person is softest  

 ah     a     a     a     aah  no  don t  don t   lotte woke with a 
shriek and tore pieces out of the thin grey shawl that covered her  

the little cretm squatted there  leaning against the wall  and 
watched her with his black eyes in which was more curiosity 
than fear or sympathy  mina birnst in from the next room  reassured 
lotte  wiped the cold sweat from her face and gave her water to 
drink into which she carefully numbered the drops of valerian  

the long summer day over the green valley seemed endless  so 
that one could not remember when it had dawned or believe that 
it would ever be dusk  here in the house  it was warm but not 
oppressive  steps echoed in the house  other citizens kept arriving 
from the town or some soldier or officer wandered about  there 
was food and fruit in abundance  milan brewed coffee continually  
it might all have seemed like some extended festival visit to the 
villages  had it not been for lotte s despairing scream which broke 
out from time to time and the sullen thunder of the guns which 
sounded in that sheltered hollow like howls of rage which showed 
that all was not well with the world  that imiversal and individual 
misfortune was nearer and greater than it seemed in the wide 
serenity of the day  

that was what war had done to lotte s hotel and its occupants  

pavle rankovid s diop was also shut  on the second day of 
the war pavle  with other prominent serbs  had been taken as a 
hostage  some of them were at the station where they answered 
with their lives for the peace  order and regular communication 
of the line  while others were not far from the bridge  in a small 
wooden shed at the far end of the square where on market days 
the municipal scales were kept and where the local octroi was paid  
there too the hostages had to answer with their lives  should 
anyone destroy or damage the bridge  

pavle was sitting there on a cafd chair  with hands on knees 
and bowed head  he looked the perfect picture of a man who  
exhausted aftor some great effort  had sat down for a moment s 
rest  but he had been ntdng there motionless in the same position 
for several hours  at the door two soldiers  reservists  sat on a 


    



pile of empty sacks  the doors were shut and the shed was dark 
and oppressively hot  when a shell from panos or goles whistled 
overhead  pavle swallowed and listened to hear where it fell  he 
knew that the bridge had been nuned and thought of that con  
tmually  asking himself whether one such shell could ignite the 
explosives should it penetrate to the charge  at every change of 
guard he listened to the non commissioned oflbicer giving instruc  
tions to the soldiers   at the least attempt to damage the bridge  
or at any suspicious sign that such a thing is being prepared  
this man must be killed at once   pavle had got used to listening to 
these words calmly as if they did not refer to him  the shells 
and shrapnel  which occasionally exploded so near the shed that 
gravel and pieces of metal struck the planks  disturbed him more  
but what tormented him most of all were his long  his endless and 
unbearable  thoughts  

he kept thinking what was to happen to him  to his house and 
his property  the more he thought  the more everything seemed like 
a bad dream  in what other way could all that had happened to 
him in the last few days be explained  the gendarmes had taken 
away his two sons  students  on the first day  his wife had remained 
at home  alone with her daughters  the great warehouse at osojnica 
had been burnt down before his eyes  his serfs from the nearby 
villages had probably been killed or dispersed  all his credits over 
the whole district  lost  his shop  the most beautiful shop m the 
whole town  only a few paces from where he was now  had been 
shut and would probably be pillaged  or set on fire by the shells  
he himself was sitting m the semi darkness of this shed  responsible 
with his life for something that in no way depended on him  for 
the fate of that bridge  

his thoughts whirled in his head  tumultuous and disordered 
as never before  they crossed and mingled and were extinguished  
what sort of connection had he with that bridge  he who all his 
life had paid no attention to anything save his work and his 
family  it was not he who had mined it  nor had he bombarded 
it  not even when he had been an apprentice and unmarried  had 
he ever sat on the kapia and wasted his time in singmg and idle 
jokes  like so many visegrad youths  all his life passed before 
his eyes  with many details which he had long ago forgotten  

he remembered how he had come from the sanjak as a fourteen  
year old boy  hungry and in shabby peasant sandals  he had struck 
a bargain with old peter to serve him for one suit of clothes  his 
food and two pairs of sandals aimually  he had looked after the 
childroi  helped in the shop  drawn water and groomed the horses  


    



he had slept under the stairs in a dark  narrow cupboard without 
windows where he could not even lie down at full length  he 
had endured this hard life and  when he was eighteen  had gone 
into the shop  on salary   his place had been taken by another 
village boy from the sanjak  in the shop he had got to know and 
understand the great idea of thnft  and had felt the fierce and 
wonderful passion in the great power that thrift gave  for five 
years he had slept in a little room behind the shop  in five years 
he had never once lit a fire or gone to sleep with a candle beside 
him  he had been twenty three when peter himself had arranged 
a marriage for him with a good and well to do girl from cajnicie 
she had been a merchant s daughter and now both of them saved 
together  then came the time of the occupation and with it livelier 
trade  easier gain and lower expenses  he made good use of the 
profits and avoided the expenses  thus he was able to get a shop 
and began to make money  at that time it was not difficult  many 
then made money easily and lost it even more easily  but what was 
made was hard to keep  he had kept his and every day made more  
when these last years came and with them unrest and  politics   
he  though already advanced in years  had tried to understand 
the new times  to stand up to them and adapt himself to them  
and to go through them without harm and without shame he had 
been vice president of the municipality  president of the religious 
community  president of the serbian choral society  concord   
main shareholder of the serbian bank and member of the executive 
committee of the local agricultural bank  he had tried his best  
according to the rules of the market place  to make his way wisely 
and honestly between the contrary influences which increased daily  
without allowing his own interests to suffer  without being regarded 
with suspicion by the authorities or brought to shame before his 
own people  in the eyes of the townsmen he passed for an inimitable 
example of industry  common sense and circumspection  

thus  for more than a half of a normal human existence he had 
worked  saved  worried and made money  he had taken care not 
to hurt a fly  been avil to all and looked only straight ahead of 
him  keeping silent and mawng money in his own way  and here 
was where it had led him  to sit between two soldiers like the 
lowest of brigands and wait until some shell or infernal machine 
should damage the bridge and  for that reason  to have his throat 
cut or be shot  he began to think  and that pained him most of all  
that he had worked and worried and ill used himself all in vain  
that he had chosen the wrong path and that his sons and all the 
other  youngsters  had been right  and that times had come without 


    



measures or calculations or which had some sort of new measures 
and different calculations  in any case his own calculations had 
been shown to be inaccurate and his measures short  

 that s the way of it   said pavle to himself   that s the way  
everyone teaches you and urges you to work and to save  the 
church  the authorities and your own common sense  you listen and 
live prudently  in fact you do not live at all  but work and save 
and are burdened with cares  and so your whole life passes  then  
all of a sudden  the whole thing turns upside down  times come 
when the world mocks at reason  when the church shuts its doors 
and is silent  when authority becomes mere brute force  when 
they who have made their money honestly and with the sweat of 
their brows lose both their time and their money  and the violent 
win the game  no one recognizes your efforts and there is no one 
to help or advise you how to keep what you have earned and 
saved can this be  surely this cannot be   pavle asked himself 
continually  and without finding any answer went back to the 
point whence his thought had started  the loss of all that he 
possessed  

try as he might to think of something else  he could not succeed  
his thoughts returned continually to the point where they had 
started  time crept by with mortal slowness  it seemed to him 
that the bridge over which he had crossed thousands of times but 
had never really looked at  now lay with all its weight on his 
shoulders like some inexplicable and fateful burden  like a night  
mare but in a sleep from which there was no awakening  

therefore pavle went on sitting there  huddled on his chair with 
bowed head and shoulders he felt the sweat oozing from every 
pore under his thick starched shirt  collar and cuffs  it fell in 
streams from under his fez  he did not wipe it away but let it 
stream down his face and fall in heavy drops to the floor and 
it seemed to him that it was his life that was draining away and 
was leaving him  

the two soldiers  middle aged hungarian peasants  remained 
silent and ate bread and ham sprinkled with paprika  they ate 
slowly  cutting off with a small penknife first a piece of bread 
and then a slice of ham as if they were in their own fields  then 
they took a mouthful of v ine from an army canteen and lit their 
short pipes puffing away  one of them said softly  

 eh  i have never seen a man sweat so much   

then they went on smoking in complete silence  

but it was not only pavle who sweated such bloody sweat and lost 
himself in that sleep from which there is no awakening  in those 


    



summer days  on that little piece of earth between the drina and the 
dry frontier  in the town  in the villages  on the roads and in the 
forests  everywhere men sought death  their own or others   and 
at the same time fled from it and defended themselves from it 
by all the means in their power  that strange human game which 
is called war became more and more intense and submitted to 
its authority hvmg creatures and material things  

not far from that municipal shed a detachment of an unusual 
army was resting  the men were in white uniforms with white 
tropical helmets on their heads  they were germans  the so called 
skadar detachment  before the war they had been sent to skadar 
 scutari in albania  where they were to maintain law and order  
together ivith detachments from other nations  as part of an inter  
national army  when war broke out  they had received orders to 
leave skadar and place themselves at the disposal of the nearest 
austrian army command on the serbian frontier  they had come 
the evening before and were now resting in the hollow which 
separated the square from the market place  there  in a sheltered 
comer  they awaited the order to attack  there were about     
of them  their captain  a plump reddish man who suffered from 
the heat  had just been cursing at the gendarmerie sergeant danilo 
repac  cursing him as only a senior officer of the german army 
can curse  noisily  pedantically and ivithout any sort of con  
sideration  the captain was complaining that his soldiers were 
dying of thirst  that they had not even the most necessary supplies  
since all the shops nearby  which were probably full of everything  
were shut despite the order that all shops were to remain open  

 what are you here for  are you gendarmes or dolls  must i die 
here with all my men  or must   break open the shops like a 
robber  find the owners at once and make them sell us provisions 
and something worth drinking  at once  do you understand what 
that means  at once   

at every word the captain grew more and more flushed  in 
his white uniform  his close shaven head red as a poppy  he seemed 
to bum with anger like a torch  

sergeant repac  astounded  only blinked and went on repeating  

 i understand  sir  at once  i understand  at once   

then  passing suddenly from his cataleptic stiffness to frenzied 
action  he turned and hurried from the market place  it seemed as if 
the sergeant  approaching too close to that captain flaming with 
anger  had himsdf been touched by that flame  which made him run  
curse  threaten and beat all round him  

the first living being whom he met in the course of his mad rush 

    



was alihodja  who had just come down from his house to cast an 
eye on his shop  looking closely at the once familiar  wachtmeistef 
repac  now completely changed  rushing towards him  the 
astonished hodja asked himself whether this savage and maddened 
man was really the same  wachtmeister  whom he had watched for 
years  calm  dignified and humane  passing in front of his shop  now 
this sombre and infuriated repac looked at him with new eyes which 
no longer recognized anyone and saw only their own fear  the 
sergeant at once began to shout  repeating what only a short time 
ago he had heard from the german captain  

 god in heaven    ought to hang all of you  weren t you ordered 
to keep your shops open  for your sake  i have had to        

and before the astonished hodja was able to utter a word  he 
slapped him hard on the right cheek so that his turban slid from his 
right ear to his left  

then the sergeant rushed frenziedly on to open other shops  the 
hodja set his turban straight  let down his door shutter and sat on 
it  almost out of his mind from astonishment  around the shop 
crowded a swarm of strange looking soldiers in white imiforms such 
as he had never seen before  it seemed to the hodja as if he were 
dreaming  but in these times when slaps fell from heaven he no 
longer felt really astonished at anything  

so the whole month passed  in preliminary bombardment of the 
bridge and in the firing from the surrotmding hills  in suffering and 
violence of every kind  and in the expectation of worse misfortunes  
in the first days the greater number of the citizens had already left 
the town which now lay between two fires  by the end of september 
the complete evacuation of the towoi began  even the last officials 
were withdrawn  by night along the road which led over the bridge  
for the railway line had already been cut  then the army was with  
drawn little by little from the right bank of the drina  there re  
mained only a small number of defence squads  a few engineers  
units and some gendarme patrols  until the orders came for them too 
to retire  

the bridge remained as if under sentence of death  but none the 
less still whole and imtouched  between the two warring sides  


    



xxiv 




d uring the night the sky clouded over as if it were autumn  
the clouds clung to the tops of the mountains and lingered 
in the valleys between them  the austrians had taken ad  
vantage of the darkness of the night to effect the with  
drawal of even the last detachments  already before dawn they were 
all not only on the right bank of the drina but on the heights behind 
the lijeste chain  out of sight and out of range of the serbian guns  

at daybreak there was a fine  almost autumnal  rain  in that rain 
the last patrols visited houses and shops in the vicinity of the bridge 
to see if there were anyone still in them  everything was as if dead  
the officers  mess  lotte s hotel  the ruined barracks and those three 
or four shops at the entrance to the market place but in front of 
alihodja s shop they came upon the hodja who had just come down 
from his house and let down his door shutter  the gendarmes  who 
knew the hodja as an eccentric  warned him most seriously to shut 
his shop at once and leave the market place  for any longer stay in 
the vicinity of the bridge was most  dangerous to life  and strictly 
forbidden  the hodja looked at them as if they were drunk and did 
not know what they were saying  he wanted to reply that life had 
been dangerous for a long time past and that everyone was more 
or less dead already and only waiting his turn to be buried  but he 
thought better of it  taught by the bad experience of the last few 
days  and merely told them calmly and naturally that he had only 
come to take something from the shop and would return home at 
once  the gendarmes  who were evidently in a hurry  warned him 
once more that he should move away as soon as possible  and went 
on across the square to the bridge  alihodja watched them marching 
away  their footfalls inaudible in the dust which the morning rain 
had turned to a thick  damp carpet  he was still watching them as 
they crossed the bridge  half concealed by the stone parapet  so that 
they could see only their heads and shoulders and the long bayonets 
on their rifles  the first rays of sunlight struck on the heights of the 
butkovo rocks  


    



all their orders were like this  severe  important and yet basically 
senseless  thought alihodja  and smiled to himself like a child who 
has outwitted his teacher  he lifted the door shutter enough to let 
him get inside and then let it fall  so that from the outside the shop 
appeared to be shut  alone in the darkness  he wriggled his way into 
that little room behind the shop where he had so often taken refuge 
from the obtrusive world  from conversations that poisoned and 
bored him  from his family and from his ovm worries  he sat down 
on the small hard chair and crossed his legs under him and sighed  
his inner self was still troubled by outward impressions  but he soon 
became calm and balanced again  the narrow room quickly filled 
with the warmth of his body and the hod a felt that sweemess of soli  
tude  peace and forgetfulness which made of the close  dark  dusty 
little room a place of endless paradisiacal gardens with green banl  
between which murmured invisible waters  

in the darkness and closeness of this narrow space he could still 
feel the freshness of the morning rain and the sunrise outside  outside 
there was an unusual silence which  for a wonder  was not broken 
by a single shot  a single voice or footfall alihodja was flooded with 
a feeling of happiness and gratitude  these few planks  he thought to 
himself  were enough  with god s help  to shelter and save a true be  
liever  like some wonder ship  from every misery and care to which 
there seemed no solution and from the guns with which the two 
enemies  both infidel and each worse than the other  were fighting 
their duel over his head  there had not been such a calm since the 
opening of hostilities  the hodja thought joyously  and silence is 
sweet and good  with it returned  at least for a moment  a little of 
that real human life which had recently groivn weaker and weaker 
and which  under the thunder of the infidel guns  had completely 
disappeared silence is for prayer  it is itself like a prayer  

at that moment the hodja felt the stool under him rise upward 
and lift him like a toy  his  sweet  silence was shattered and suddenly 
transformed into a dull roar and a great smashing that filled the air  
tore at the eardrums and became universal and unbearable  the 
shelves on the wall opposite cracked and the things on them leapt at 
him as he at them  ah  shrieked the hodja  or rather he only thought 
that he shrieked for he himself no longer had voice or hearing  even 
as he no longer had any place on the earth ever hing was deafened 
by sound  shattered  torn up by the roots and whirled about him  im  
probable as it seemed  he felt as if the little tongue of land between 
the two rivers on which the town was built had been plucked out 
of the earth vnth a terrific noise and thrown into space in which it 
was still flying  that the two rivers had been tom out of their beds 


    



and drawn upward to the skies  only to fall once more with all their 
mass of waters into the void  like two waterfalls which had not yet 
been halted or broken  was not this kiyamet  that last day of judg  
ment of which books and learned men spoke  in which this lying 
world would be burnt up in the twinkling of an eye  like one stubs 
out a spark  but what need had god  whose glance was enough to 
ctcate and to extinguish worlds  with such a chaos  this was not 
divine  but if not  how had human hands such power  how could 
he  so astonished  so deceived  so overwhelmed by this temble blow 
which seemed to destroy  break up and suffocate everything down 
to man s very thought  give an answer to this  he did not know what 
power it was that bore him up  he did not know where he was flying 
nor where he would stop  but he knew that he  alihodja  had always 
and in everything been right  ah  shrieked the hodja once again  but 
this time with pain for that same force that had lifted him up now 
threw him roughly and violently back again  but not to the place 
where he had been but to the floor between the wooden wall and 
the overturned stool  he felt a dull blow on his head and a pain under 
his knees and in his back  now he could tell only by ear  like a sound 
separate and distinct from the universal thundering  that something 
heavy had struck the roof of the shop and that  there behind the par  
tition  had begun a clashing and breaking of wooden and metal ob  
jects as if all the things in the shop had come alive  were flying about 
and colliding in mid air but alihodja had already lost consciousness 
and lay motionless in his little room  as if it were indeed his coffin  

outside it was by now full day  

he could not have said even approximately how long he lay there  
what roused him out of his deep unconsciousness was a light and at 
the same time the sound of voices  he came to himself with diffi  
culty  he knew very well that he was lying there in complete dark  
ness and yet through the narrow entrance a ray of light reached him 
from the shop  he remembered how the world had been filled with 
sound and uproar in which a man s hearing was deafened and his en  
tr ai l s melted within him  now there was silence once more  but no 
longer like that silence that had seemed to him so sweet before the 
cataclysm that had thrown him down where he was now  but like 
some evil sister of it  how deep was this silence he best realized by 
some weak voices which  as if from a great distance  were shouting 
his name  

realizing that he was alive and still in his little room  the hodja 
extricated himself from the mass of objects that had fallen on top 
of him from the shelves  and rose  groaning continually and uttering 
cries of pain  now he could hear the voices from the street clearly  

    



he went down and crawled through the narrow opening into the 
shop  it was littered with fallen and broken objects  all in the full 
light of day  the shop was wide open  for the door shutter  which he 
had left leaning but unlocked  had been knocked over by the blast  

in the chaos and disorder of scattered goods and damaged objects 
that lay in the centre of the shop was a heavy stone about the size of 
a man s head the hodja looked up  clearly the stone had flovm 
through the air  breaking through the weak roof of wooden shingles  
alihodja looked again at the stone  white and porous  smooth and 
clean cut on two sides but sharp and crudely broken on the other 
two   ah  the bridge   thought the hodja but the voices from the 
street summoned him even more loudly and peremptorily and 
would not let him think  

bruised and still only half conscious  the hodja found himself face 
to face with a group of five or six young men  dusty and unshaven  
in grey uniforms with forage caps on their heads and peasant sandals 
on their feet  all were armed and wore crossed bandoliers filled with 
small  shining bullets  with them was vlado marid the locksmith  
but without his usual cap  wearing a fur hat and with the same cart  
ridge belts across his chest  one of the men  clearly the leader  a 
young man with thin black moustaches and a regular face with fine 
features and fiery eyes  at once addressed the hodja  he was carrying 
his rifle over his shoulder like a hunter and had a thin hazel switch 
in his right hand  

 hey  you  do you usually leave your shop wide open  if anything 
is missing you will say that my soldiers have pillaged it  do you ex  
pect me to look after your goods for you   

the man s face was calm  almost without expression  but his voice 
was angry and the switch in his hand was raised threateningly  
vlado marid came up and whispered to him  

 very well  then  perhaps he is a good and honest man  but if i find 
he has left his shop yawning wide open again  he will not get off so 
easily   

the armed men went on their way  

 those are the others   said the hodja to himself  looking after 
them   why should they light on me as soon as they come into the 
town  it seems that nothing can change in this town without the 
whole lot falling on my head   

he stood in front of his damaged shop  mouth open  with heavy 
head and broken body  before him lay the square which  in the 
early morning sun  looked like a battlefield  scattered with large and 
small bits of stone  tiles and broken branches  his gaze turned to the 
bridge  the kapia was there where it had always been  but just be  


    



yond the kapia the bridge stopped short  there was no longer any 
seventh pier  between the sixth and the eighth yawned a gulf 
through which he could see the green waters of the river  from the 
eighth pier onward the bridge once more stretched to the farther 
bank  smooth and regular and white  as it had been yesterday and 
always  

the hodja blinked his eyes several times in unbelief  then he 
closed them before his inward sight appeared the memory of those 
soldiers whom he had seen six years before  concealed beneath a 
green tent  digging at that very pier  and he recalled the picture of 
that iron manhole which in later years had covered the entrance into 
the mined interior of the pier  and also the enigmatic yet eloquent 
face of sergeant major brankovid  deaf  blind and dumb  he started 
and opened his eyes again  but everything in front of him remained 
just as it was before  the square  scattered with large and small 
islocks of stone  and the bridge without one of its piers and a yawn  
ing gulf between two roughly broken arches  

only in dreams could one see and experience such things  only in 
dreams  but when he turned away from this improbable sight  there 
stood before him his shop with the great stone  a tiny part of that 
seventh nier  among his scattered goods  if it was a dream  it was 
everywhere  

further down the square he could hear shouting  loud words of 
command in serbian and steps hurriedly drawing nearer  alihodja 
rapidly put up his door shutter  locked it with a great padlock and 
began to make his way home  uphill  

earlier too it had happened to him that while he was thus going 
uphill his breath had failed him and he had felt his heart beating 
where it should not have been  for a long time past  from his fiftieth 
year  he had found the hill on which his house was built steeper and 
steeper and the way home longer and longer  but never so long as it 
was today when he wanted to get away from the market place as 
quickly as possible and get home as soon as he could  his heart was 
beating as it should not have  his breath failed him and he was forced 
to halt  

down below there  it seemed  they were singing  down below 
there  too  was the ruined bridge  horribly  cruelly cut in half there 
was no need for him to turn  and he would not have turned for any  
thing in the world  to see the whole picture  in the distance the pier 
cut short like a gigantic tree trunk and scattered in a thousand pieces 
and the arches to left and right of it brutally cut short the broken 
arches yawned painfully towards one another across the break  

no  not for anything would he have turned round  but he could 


    



not go forward  uphill  for his heart stifled him more and more and 
his legs refused to obey him  he began to breathe more and more 
deeply  slowly  in measure  each time more deeply  that had always 
helped him before  it helped him now  his chest seemed to grow 
easier  between the measured deep breathing and the beating of his 
heart he established a sort of balance  he began to walk once more 
and the thought of home and bed stimulated and drove him on  he 
walked painfully and slowly and before his eyes  as if it moved along 
in front of him  was the whole scene with the ruined bridge  it was 
not enough to turn one s back on a thing for it to cease to goad and 
torment one  even when he shut his eyes he could still see it  

yes  thought the hodja more animatedly  for he was now breathing 
a little more easily  now one can see what all their tools and their 
equipment really meant  all their hurry and activity   he had always 
been right  always  in everything and despite everybody  but that no 
longer gave him any satisfaction  for the first time it did not really 
matter  he had been only too right   for so many years he had seen 
how they had always been concerning themselves with the bridge  
they had cleaned it  embellished it  repaired it down to its founda  
tions  taken the water supply across it  lit it with electricity and 
then one day blown it all into the skies as if it had been some stone 
in a mountain quarry and not a thing of beauty and value  a bequest  
now one could see what they were and what they wanted  he had 
always known that but now  now even the most stupid of fools could 
see it for himself they had begun to attack even the strongest and 
most lasting of things  to take things away even from god  and who 
knew where it would stop  even the vezir s bridge had begun to 
crumble away like a necklace  and once it began no one could hold 
it back  

the hodja halted again  his breath failed him and the slope sud  
denly grew steeper before him again he had to calm his heartbeats 
with deep breathing again he succeeded in recovering his breath  
felt himself revive and walked on more quickly  

so be it  thought the hodja  if they destroy here  then somewhere 
else someone else is building  surely there are still peaceful countries 
and men of good sense who know o  god s love  if god had aban  
doned this unlucky town on the drina  he had surely not abandoned 
the whole world that was beneath the skies  they would not do this 
for ever  but who knows   oh  if only he could breathe a little more 
deeply  get a little more air   who knows  perhaps this impure infidel 
faith that puts eveiything in order  cleans eveiything up  repairs and 
embellishes everything only in order suddenly and violently to 
demolish and destroy  might spread through the whole world  it 


    



might make of all god s world an empty field for its senseless 
building and criminal destruction  a pasturage for its insatiable 
hunger and incomprehensible demands  anything might happen  
but one thing could not happen  it could not be that great and wise 
men of exalted soul who would raise lasting buildings for the love 
of god  so that the world should be more beautiful and man live in 
it better and more easily  should everywhere and for all time vanish 
from this earth  should they too vanish  it would mean that the 
love of god was extinguished and had disappeared from the world  
that could not be  

filled with his thoughts  the hodja walked more heavily and 
slowly  

now they could clearly be heard singing in the market place  if 
only he had been able to breathe in more air  if only the road were 
less steep  if only he were able to reach home  lie down on his divan 
and see and hear someone of his own about him  that was all that he 
wanted now  but he could not  he could no longer maintain that fine 
balance between his breathing and his heartbeats  his heart had now 
completely stifled his breath  as had sometimes happened to him in 
dreams  only from this dream there was no awakening to bring 
relief  he opened his mouth wide and felt his eyes bulging in his head  
the slope which until then had been growing steeper and steeper 
was now quite close to his face  his whole field of vision was filled 
by that dry  rough road which became darkness and enveloped him  

on the slope which led upwards to mejdan lay alihodja and 
breathed out his life in short gasps

ramblas every year and who venture  with a certain trepidation  
perhaps  into the maze of narrow alleys in that part of the town  
their curiosity aroused by the unfamiliarity of everything and 
intrigued by what must be called local colour  this book provides 
some answers it describes the way people live down there  without 
getting too solemn about it  

music halls  popular revue theatres  dancers who are ten a penny  
laughter  hot sunshine  bars with cheap wine and cheaper brandy  
prostitutes and drunks  sellers of lottery tickets and cripples in wheel 
chairs  flower markets  processions and sardanas  the dull explosion 
of a bomb in the distance  the entire population of a city walking 
home through the ram while the lighted trams pass on their way 
without a soul inside     

much of this puzzles the foreigner  but from clifford king s vivid 
picture of life in the narrow streets of barcelona  where he has 
himself lived for a long time  there emerges an attitude towards 
things which is not without relevance to the general contemporary 
situation despite the poverty  the misery and the squalor  the 
spaniard you will find  is not sorry for himself and he does not 
want your sympathy

to whom she will 

 a bnlliant performance and a delight to read        the book is con  
tinuously funny even where it is sad  and among publishers  dis  
coveries this novel deserves a high and permanent place    michael 

sadleir 

 not only does it depict life in present day delhi but  in its 
subtlety and in the excellence of its writing it seems to suggest 
that at long last a real anglo indian literature may be growing 
up        there have surely been few better expositions of the work  
ings of the indian mind than this intelligent and irresistibly amusing 
novel    the times  

the literary comparison which came to my mind was jane 

austen r  prawer jhabvala has a gentle irony which she allows 

to play across her characters  they are for the most part small and 
mean and ridiculous  but however small and mean they may be  
she does not despise them  her laughter is the warm laughter of 
someone who has seen how absurd people are and who loves them 
for this absurdity    arthur calder marshall in bbc european

the legion of the damned 

sven hassel 

this is the story  in the form of a novel  of a man of mixed danish 
and austrian descent who  having served a penod in a concentration 
camp for attempting to escape from germany  was transferred to 
a penal regiment and fought for the germans throughout the war  
mainly on the russian front  in effect it is one of the most damning 
tracts against wars and those who wage them that have ever come 
into the publisher s hands  

though not without a considerable element of humour  the 
horrors of the concentration camp  the terrible discipline of the 
penal regiment and the savagery of the russians are depicted with 
a painful realism that require of its readers a strong stomach  

 strangely reminiscent of that very different and wholly delight  
ful wartime best seller  the good soldier schweik       although it 
has these light hearted moments  most of the book is only too 
savagely reafistic    sphere
